<b>Transcriber's Note:</b>
</p>

<p>
     Inconsistent hyphenation and spelling in the original document have
     been preserved. Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.
</p>
<p>
     In some cases, Bancroft uses both "u" and "v" to spell an
     author's name, e.g. Vetancurt and Vetancvrt.
</p>
<p>
     Other archaic letter substitutions include "b" for "v" and "i" for
     "y" and vice versa. These have been left as printed.
</p>
     <p>Possible printer's errors include:</p>
<ul class="none">
    <li>On <a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>, córtes extraordinary should possibly be córtes extraordinarias.</li>
    <li>On <a href="#Patsun">page 149</a>, Patsun should possibly be Patzún.</li>
    <li>On <a href="#quarters">page 270</a>, quarters should possibly be halves.</li>
    <li>On <a href="#repeated">page 387</a> repeated should possibly be repealed.</li>
    <li>On <a href="#Page_652">page 652</a>, 1855-5 appears to be an error.</li>

</p>

<p>
The opening century was pregnant with important
events both in Europe and America. By 1808 affairs
in Spain culminated in the French emperor's detention
of the king and other members of the royal
family at Bayonne, where he forced them finally to
resign in his favor their rights to the Spanish crown.
The circle surrounding the captain-general, audiencia,
and archbishop of Guatemala was made up, not
only of European Spaniards, but of Guatemalans
belonging to the so-called noble families. Popular
displeasure was manifested both against the Spaniards
and against the provincial aristocracy.<a name='FA_I-1' id='FA_I-1' href='#FN_I-1' class='fnanchor'>[I-1]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_2' name='Page_2' href='#Page_2'>2</a></span>
oligarchy was hated throughout the province of Guatemala
proper, and still more in the other provinces
of the presidency.
</p>

<p>
However, when the news of Napoleon's usurpation
reached America, it caused a strong revulsion of
feeling in Central America, as well as elsewhere in
the Spanish dominions, even among the large class
which had hitherto secretly fostered a warm desire
for independent national existence. Creoles of pure
Spanish descent, though yearning to be free from the
old thraldom, could not bring themselves to discard
the country which gave them blood, religion, and
civilization. As to the educated Indians, who were
also among the wishers for independence, like all of
their race, they looked up to the ruling power with
reverence and fear. Thus arose a struggle between
the old veneration and the love of freedom; a struggle
which was to last in Central America a few years
longer, though the people were becoming more and
more impatient, while leaning to the side of independent
nationality. Circumstances seemed to demand
that the old connection should not be ruptured till
1821, when decisive results in New Spain brought on
the final crisis here. When the news of Napoleon's
acts of violence and usurpations reached Guatemala,
popular loyalty was aroused, and showed itself in
various ways. Manifestations by the authorities, expressive
of fealty to the mother country and the royal
family, met with an apparently hearty response from
the people.
</p>

<p>
Advices came on the 30th of June, 1808, of the
occurrences at Aranjuez of March 19th.<a name='FA_I-2' id='FA_I-2' href='#FN_I-2' class='fnanchor'>[I-2]</a> July passed
amid much anxiety about affairs in Spain, and the
public mind became depressed by unfavorable news
received on the 13th of August. Next day, at a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_3' name='Page_3' href='#Page_3'>3</a></span>
meeting of the authorities,<a name='FA_I-3' id='FA_I-3' href='#FN_I-3' class='fnanchor'>[I-3]</a> the state of affairs was
anxiously discussed. The mariscal de campo, Antonio
Gonzalez Mollinedo y Saravia, had succeeded
Dolmas on the 28th of July, 1801, in the offices of
governor, captain-general, and president of the audiencia.
He had seen forty years of service in the
royal armies,<a name='FA_I-4' id='FA_I-4' href='#FN_I-4' class='fnanchor'>[I-4]</a> and had with him his wife, Micaela Colarte,
and offspring.<a name='FA_I-5' id='FA_I-5' href='#FN_I-5' class='fnanchor'>[I-5]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SARAVIA AND FERNANDO VII.
</p>

<p>
President Saravia read to the meeting a despatch
from the viceroy of Mexico, and a copy of the <i>Gaceta</i>
giving an account of the abdication of Fernando VII.,
and of the surrender by other members of the royal
family of their rights to the Spanish crown. After
due consideration, the meeting declared these acts to
have resulted from violence, being therefore illegal
and unjust, and not entitled to recognition. It was
further resolved that the authorities and people should
renew their allegiance to the legitimate sovereign,
continue upholding the laws hitherto in force, and
maintain unity of action, for the sake of religion,
peace, and good order. Instructions were received<a name='FA_I-6' id='FA_I-6' href='#FN_I-6' class='fnanchor'>[I-6]</a>
to raise the standard of Fernando VII., and swear
allegiance to him, which were duly carried out.<a name='FA_I-7' id='FA_I-7' href='#FN_I-7' class='fnanchor'>[I-7]</a>
</p>

<p>
The opportunity has now arrived for a radical
change in the political status of Spanish America.
The colonies have hitherto had no government, save
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_4' name='Page_4' href='#Page_4'>4</a></span>
that of rulers set over them by a monarch whose will
was absolute, whose edicts constituted their code of
laws; the subject being allowed no voice in public
affairs, save occasionally as a timid petitioner. But
troubles beset Spain at this time. Her king is powerless;
the friends of constitutional government have
now the control, and proceed to establish the desired
liberal régime. In order to be consistent, and to some
extent satisfy the aspirations of their fellow-subjects
in America, the provisional government decrees, and
the córtes upon assembling confirm, all the rights
claimed for Spaniards dwelling in Spain, together
with representation in the córtes and other national
councils.
</p>

<p>
The Junta Suprema Central Gubernativa in the
king's name declares on the 22d of January, 1809, the
Spanish possessions in America to be, in fact, integral
parts of the monarchy,<a name='FA_I-8' id='FA_I-8' href='#FN_I-8' class='fnanchor'>[I-8]</a> and, approving the report of
the council of the Indies of November 21, 1808, in
favor of granting to the American dominions representation
near the sovereign, and the privilege of
forming by deputies a part of the aforesaid junta,
issues to the president of Guatemala an order to invite
the people of the provinces to choose their deputy to
reside at court as a member of the governing junta.<a name='FA_I-9' id='FA_I-9' href='#FN_I-9' class='fnanchor'>[I-9]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_5' name='Page_5' href='#Page_5'>5</a></span>
On the 3d of March, 1810, the electors assembled in
Guatemala and chose for deputy the colonel of militia,
Manuel José Pavon y Muñoz.<a name='FA_I-10' id='FA_I-10' href='#FN_I-10' class='fnanchor'>[I-10]</a> The powers given
him by his constituents were general, but enjoined
allegiance to the king and permanent connection with
the mother country.<a name='FA_I-11' id='FA_I-11' href='#FN_I-11' class='fnanchor'>[I-11]</a>

</p>

<p>
The supreme government, early in 1810, in its anxiety
to be surrounded by the representatives of the
people, hastened the convocation of córtes extraordinary.
Fearing, however, that there might not be
a sufficient number chosen for their timely attendance
at the opening of the session, it apprised the provincial
authorities, reiterating the decree a little later,<a name='FA_I-12' id='FA_I-12' href='#FN_I-12' class='fnanchor'>[I-12]</a>
that deficiencies would be temporarily supplied until
regularly elected deputies presented themselves to
occupy their seats in the chamber. Guatemala, in
common with the rest of America, was unable to send
her deputies in time, and had to be represented at
the inauguration by suplentes, or proxies. These<a name='FA_I-13' id='FA_I-13' href='#FN_I-13' class='fnanchor'>[I-13]</a>
were Andrés del Llano, a post-captain, and Colonel
Manuel del Llano. One of the first acts of the córtes<a name='FA_I-14' id='FA_I-14' href='#FN_I-14' class='fnanchor'>[I-14]</a>
was to confirm the principle that all the Spanish
dominions possessed the same rights, promising to
enact at an early day laws conducive to the welfare
of the American portion, and to fix the number and
form of national representation in both continents.
</p>

<p>
At the suggestion of the diputacion americana, as
the body of American members was called, a general
amnesty for political offences was decreed, with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
expectation of its yielding the best results in favor of
peace and conciliation. Promises of reform, and of
better days for Central America, were held out, but
the provincial government paid little attention to
them. Meanwhile a jealous and restless police constantly
watched the movements of suspected persons.
Informers and spies lurked everywhere, seeking for
some one against whom to bring charges.
</p>

<p>
The promised blessings proved delusive. Instead
of reforms, the people witnessed the installation of a
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">tribunal de fidelidad</span>, with large powers, for the trial
and punishment of suspected persons.<a name='FA_I-15' id='FA_I-15' href='#FN_I-15' class='fnanchor'>[I-15]</a> This court
was short lived, however, being suppressed about the
middle of the following year, under the order of the
supreme government, dated February 20, 1811. And
thus Guatemala was kept quiet and apparently loyal,
when the greater part of Spanish America was in
open revolt.
</p>

<p>
Saravia's rule came to an end on the 14th of March,
1811. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general,
and appointed by the government at Cádiz
to the command in chief of the forces in Mexico. On
his arrival in Oajaca, the viceroy, who was chagrined
at his powers having been thus curtailed, detained
him at that place. In November 1812, the city being
captured by the independents, Saravia was taken
prisoner and shot.<a name='FA_I-16' id='FA_I-16' href='#FN_I-16' class='fnanchor'>[I-16]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
BUSTAMANTE Y GUERRA.
</p>

<p>
The successor of Saravia was Lieutenant-general
José Bustamante y Guerra, appointed by the supreme
council of regency, and soon after confirmed by the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">córtes generales extraordinarias</span>. He was a naval
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
officer, and had made several important cruises in the
cause of science,<a name='FA_I-17' id='FA_I-17' href='#FN_I-17' class='fnanchor'>[I-17]</a> and latterly had been civil and military
governor of Montevideo, a position that he filled
efficiently. His zeal against the independents in that
country pointed him out as the one best fitted to retard
the independence of Central America. On his
return to Spain from South America he refused to
recognize Joseph Bonaparte.
</p>

<p>
Bustamante is represented to have been an inflexible,
vigilant, and reticent ruler. He lost no time in
adopting stringent measures to check insurrections,
and displayed much tact in choosing his agents and
spies. No intelligent native of the country was free
from mistrust, slight suspicion too often bringing upon
the subject search of domicile, imprisonment, or exile.
He never hesitated to set aside any lenient measures
emanating from the home government in favor of the
suspected, and spared no means that would enable
him, at the expiration of his term, to surrender the
country entire and at peace to his superiors. He was
successful, notwithstanding there were several attempts
at secession.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the American representatives had been
permitted to lift their voice in the national councils.
They had called attention to the grievances of their
people. In a long memorial of August 1, 1811, to
the córtes, they had refuted the oft-repeated charge
that the friends of independence in America were or
had been under Napoleonic influence. They set forth
the causes of discontent,<a name='FA_I-18' id='FA_I-18' href='#FN_I-18' class='fnanchor'>[I-18]</a> which they declared was of
long standing, and called for a remedy. Reference
was made to Macanar's memorial to Felipe V.,<a name='FA_I-19' id='FA_I-19' href='#FN_I-19' class='fnanchor'>[I-19]</a> wherein
he stated that the Americans were displeased, not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_8' name='Page_8' href='#Page_8'>8</a></span>
so much because they were under subjection to Spain,
as because they were debased and enslaved by the
men sent out by the crown to fill the judicial and
other offices.<a name='FA_I-20' id='FA_I-20' href='#FN_I-20' class='fnanchor'>[I-20]</a>

<p>
The organic code was finally adopted on the 18th
of March, 1812.<a name='FA_I-21' id='FA_I-21' href='#FN_I-21' class='fnanchor'>[I-21]</a> The instrument consisted of ten
titles, divided into chapters, in their turn subdivided
into sections, and might be considered in two parts:
1st, general form of government for the whole nation,
namely, a constitutional monarchy; 2d, special plan
for the administration of the Indies.<a name='FA_I-22' id='FA_I-22' href='#FN_I-22' class='fnanchor'>[I-22]</a>

NEW ORGANIC CODE.
</p>

<p>
In lieu of the old ayuntamientos, which were made
up of hereditary regidores, whose offices might be
transferred or sold, others were created, their members
to be chosen by electors who had been in their
turn chosen by popular vote. The ayuntamientos
were to control the internal police of their towns,
their funds, public instruction within their respective
localities, benevolent establishments, and local improvements.
They were to be under the inspection
of a diputacion provincial, formed of seven members,
elected by the above-mentioned electors, in each province,
under the presidency of the chief civil officer appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_9' name='Page_9' href='#Page_9'>9</a></span>
by the king; the chief and the diputacion
were jointly to have the direction of the economical
affairs of the province. No act of either corporation
was final till approved by the national córtes. In
America and Asia, however, owing to great distances,
moneys lawfully appropriated might be used with the
assent of the chief civil authority; but a timely report
was to be made to the supreme government for
the consideration of the córtes. Such were the chief
wheels in the machinery of provincial and municipal
administration. Now, as to popular rights, equality
of representation in the provinces of the Spanish
peninsula, Asia, and America was fully recognized.
The descendants of Africans were alone deprived of
the rights of citizenship. This exclusion was combated
with forcible arguments by many of the American
deputies setting forth the faithful, efficient services
colored men had repeatedly rendered and were still
rendering to the nation, and their fitness for almost
every position. Many of them, they said, had received
sacred orders, or had been engaged in other
honorable callings, in which they had made good records;
besides which, they comprised a considerable
portion of the useful mining and agricultural population.
Unfortunately for the negro race, the American
deputies were not all of one mind. Larrazábal, from
Guatemala, probably acting both on his own judgment
and on the opinion expressed in 1810 by the real consulado,
asserted the black man's incapacity, advocating
that persons of African blood should be conceded
only the privilege of voting at elections. This motion
was supported by a Peruvian deputy. The peninsular
members favored the admission to full rights of colored
priests, and all colored men serving in the royalist
armies. The measure was lost, however; but the
article as passed authorized the admission to full
political rights, by special acts of the córtes, of colored
men proving themselves worthy by a remarkably virtuous
life, good service to the country, talents, or industriousness,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_10' name='Page_10' href='#Page_10'>10</a></span>
provided they were born in wedlock,
of fathers who had been born free, married to free-born
wives, and were residents of Spanish possessions,
practising some useful profession and owning property.
</p>

<p>
Pursuant to the constitution, the córtes ordered,
May 23, 1812, elections for members to the ordinary
córtes of 1813.<a name='FA_I-23' id='FA_I-23' href='#FN_I-23' class='fnanchor'>[I-23]</a>
</p>

<p>
The constitution was received at Guatemala on
the 10th of September, 1812, proclaimed on the 24th,
and its support solemnly sworn to by the authorities
and people on the 3d of November, with great satisfaction
and evidences of loyalty. Gold and silver
medals were struck off to commemorate the event.<a name='FA_I-24' id='FA_I-24' href='#FN_I-24' class='fnanchor'>[I-24]</a>
</p>

<p>
The installation of the córtes took place, with the
apparent approval of Guatemala. The president,
members of the audiencia, and other dignitaries who
had thriven under absolutism, looking on Americans
as 'our colonists,' became at once liberals and constitutionalists,
pretending to recognize the wisdom of
the national congress in declaring that the Americans
were no longer colonists, but citizens of one common
country. Their manifestation of September 15, 1812,
was followed three days after by one from the ayuntamiento
of Guatemala to Deputy Larrazábal, in the
same strain, suggesting the creation of a board advisory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_11' name='Page_11' href='#Page_11'>11</a></span>
to the córtes, on the reino de Guatemala legislation.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
EXPEDITION TO OAJACA.
</p>

<p class="p2">
After the fall of Oajaca during the Mexican war of
independence, the patriot chief Morelos regarded the
rear of his military operations as secure. Sympathizing
messages had reached him from men of weight in
Guatemala, which lulled him into the belief that attack
need not be apprehended from this quarter. To
Ignacio Rayon he wrote: "Good news from Guatemala;
they have asked for the plan of government,
and I'll send them the requisite information." It was
all a mistake. His cause had friends in Central
America, and enemies likewise. Among the most
prominent of the latter were Captain-general Bustamante
and Archbishop Casaus. The ecclesiastic, with
a number of Spanish merchants from Oajaca who had
sought refuge in Guatemala, prompted the general,
then anxious to avenge the execution of his predecessor,
to fit out an expedition, invade Oajaca, and
harass the insurgents even at the gates of the city.
</p>

<p>
About 700 men, mostly raw recruits, were accordingly
put in the field, early in 1813, under the command
of Lieutenant-colonel Dambrini, a man of
little ability and unsavory record, and crossed the
line into Tehuantepec. Dambrini could not abandon
his money-making propensities; and having been
led to believe he would encounter but little or no
resistance, took along a large quantity of merchandise
for trading. On the 25th of February a small insurgent
force was captured in Niltepec, and Dambrini
had its commander, together with a Dominican priest
and twenty-eight others, shot the next day. This was
the usual treatment of prisoners by both belligerents.
But on April 20th the Guatemalans were flanked and
routed at Tonalá by the enemy under Matamoros.
Dambrini fled, and his men dispersed, leaving in the
victors' possession their arms, ammunition, and Dambrini's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
trading goods. The fugitives were pursued
some distance into Guatemalan territory.<a name='FA_I-25' id='FA_I-25' href='#FN_I-25' class='fnanchor'>[I-25]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
Germs of independence, as I have said, were fostered
in secret by the more intelligent, and slowly
began to develop, the movement being hastened by a
few enthusiasts who were blind to the foolhardiness
of their attempt. The government tried all means to
keep the people in ignorance of the state of affairs in
Mexico and South America, and when unsuccessful,
would represent the royalist army as victorious. Other
more questionable devices were also resorted to.<a name='FA_I-26' id='FA_I-26' href='#FN_I-26' class='fnanchor'>[I-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
Undue restraint and ill treatment, as practised under
the stringent policy of Bustamante, soon began
to produce effects. Restiveness and despair seized a
portion of the people; the hopes for a government
more consonant with the spirit of the age, which had
been held out from Spain, evaporated. Men were
unwilling to live longer under the heel of despotism;
and the more high-spirited in Salvador and Nicaragua
resolved to stake their fortunes upon a bold stroke
for freedom. It was, indeed, a rash step, undertaken
without concert, and almost without resources. It
could but end as it did at every place where a revolutionary
movement was initiated.

<p>
Matías Delgado and Nicolás Aguilar, curates of
San Salvador, Manuel and Vicente Aguilar, Juan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
Manuel Rodriguez, and Manuel José Arce were the
first to strike the blow for Central American independence.
Their plan was carried into execution on the
5th of November, 1811, by the capture of 3,000 new
muskets, and upwards of $200,000 from the royal
treasury at San Salvador. They were supported by
a large portion of the people of the city, and in
Metapan, Zacatecoluca, Usulutan, and Chalatenango.
But other places in the province of Salvador, namely,
San Miguel, Santa Ana, San Vicente, and Sonsonate,
renewed their pledges of fealty to the government,
declaring the movement for freedom a sacrilege.<a name='FA_I-27' id='FA_I-27' href='#FN_I-27' class='fnanchor'>[I-27]</a>
</p>

<p>
The promoters of the revolt, which had been started
in the king's name, became disheartened and gave up
further effort, and with the dismissal of the intendente,
Antonio Gutierrez Ulloa, and other officials, peace was
soon restored. San Salvador had been quiet without
other government than that of alcaldes during the
disturbance.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
AYCINENA IN SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
Upon the receipt of the news of these occurrences,
Bustamante despatched Colonel José de Aycinena
with ample powers to take charge of the intendencia,
and restore quiet. He had been getting troops ready
to send down, but by the mediation of the ayuntamiento
of Guatemala he had suspended preparations,
and had adopted the former course. A member of
that body, José María Peinado, was associated with
Aycinena.<a name='FA_I-28' id='FA_I-28' href='#FN_I-28' class='fnanchor'>[I-28]</a> They reached San Salvador on the 3d
of December, amid the acclamations of the fickle populace;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
their presence and the exhortations of the
missionaries checked all revolutionary symptoms.
The authors of the revolt were leniently treated
under a general amnesty.<a name='FA_I-29' id='FA_I-29' href='#FN_I-29' class='fnanchor'>[I-29]</a> Peinado was a short time
after appointed Aycinena's successor as acting intendente.<a name='FA_I-30' id='FA_I-30' href='#FN_I-30' class='fnanchor'>[I-30]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another and a still more serious attempt at revolution,
which may be called a sequel to that of Salvador,
had its beginning in the town of Leon, Nicaragua,
on the 13th of December, 1811, when the people
deposed the intendente, José Salvador. This action
was seconded on the 22d at Granada, where the
inhabitants, at a meeting in the municipal hall, demanded
the retirement of all the Spanish officials.
The insurgents, on the 8th of January, 1812, by a
coup-de-main captured Fort San Cárlos. The officials
fled to Masaya. Villa de Nicaragua—the city of
Rivas in later times—and other towns at once adopted
the same course.
</p>

<p>
Early in 1812, after the first excitement had become
somewhat allayed, a board of government was
organized in Leon, the members of which were Francisco
Quiñones, Domingo Galarza, Cármen Salazar,
and Basilio Carrillo. Bishop Fray Nicolás García
Jerez was recognized as gobernador intendente by
all the towns, and his authority was only limited in
one point, namely, he was in no way to favor the deposed
officials. The people of Granada resolved to
send two deputies to the board.<a name='FA_I-31' id='FA_I-31' href='#FN_I-31' class='fnanchor'>[I-31]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
REVOLUTION IN NICARAGUA.
</p>

<p>
The royal officials at Masaya having called for
assistance from Guatemala, Bustamante had 1,000
or more troops placed there under command of Sargento
Mayor Pedro Gutierrez. The people of Leon
had ere this accepted an amnesty from Bishop Jerez,
and thereafter took no part in movements against the
crown. Granada, more firm of purpose, resolved upon
defence; caused intrenchments to be built to guard
all avenues leading to the plaza, and mounted thereon
twelve heavy cannon. A royalist force, under José
M. Palomar, on the 21st of April approached Granada
to reconnoitre, and reached the plazuela de Jalteva.<a name='FA_I-32' id='FA_I-32' href='#FN_I-32' class='fnanchor'>[I-32]</a>
Early in the morning he opened a brisk fire on the
town, and kept it up for several hours. After a parley,
next day the citizens agreed to surrender, on Gutierrez
solemnly pledging the names of the king and
Bustamante, as well as his own, that they should in
no wise be molested. But after the royal troops were
allowed to enter the city on the 28th, Bustamante,
ignoring the solemn guarantees pledged by his subordinate,
ordered the arrest and prosecution of the
leaders. The governor accordingly named Alejandro
Carrascosa fiscal to prosecute the conspirators of
Granada. The proceedings occupied two years, at
the end of which the fiscal called for, and the court
granted, the confiscation of the estates, in addition to
the penalties awarded to those found guilty. Sixteen
of the prisoners, as heads of the rebellion, were sentenced
to be shot, nine were doomed to the chain-gang
for life, and 133 to various terms of hard labor.<a name='FA_I-33' id='FA_I-33' href='#FN_I-33' class='fnanchor'>[I-33]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'>16</a></span>
The sentence of death was not carried out, however.
The condemned were taken to Guatemala, and thence
transported to Spain, where the majority died as exiles.
Four others were removed as convicts to Omoa
and Trujillo. The survivors were finally released by
a royal order of June 25, 1817.<a name='FA_I-34' id='FA_I-34' href='#FN_I-34' class='fnanchor'>[I-34]</a>

I remarked, a bad effect upon the country.<a name='FA_I-35' id='FA_I-35' href='#FN_I-35' class='fnanchor'>[I-35]</a> From

Notwithstanding the existing grievances and the

did not fail to respond to the calls from the home government

pecuniary aid to meet the enormous expenses of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
war against Napoleon's forces, and other pressing demands.
In 1812 there were collected and remitted
as donations $43,538. The citizens of San Salvador
also agreed to give $12,000 for 1812, and an equal
sum in 1813, if they could obtain a certain reform for
the benefit of indigo-planters.<a name='FA_I-37' id='FA_I-37' href='#FN_I-37' class='fnanchor'>[I-37]</a>

FANATICISM.

<p class="p2">
We have seen how the first steps toward independence
failed. Nor could any other result have been
expected from the degraded condition, socially and
intellectually, of the masses. The people were controlled
by fanaticism, in abject submission to king and
clergy. Absurd doctrines and miracles were implicitly
believed in; and every effort made to draw the
ignorant people out of that slough was in their judgment
treason and sacrilege, a violation of the laws of
God, an attempt to rob the king of his rights; certain
to bring on a disruption of social ties, and the wrath
of heaven. The lower orders had been taught that
freedom signified the reign of immorality and crime,
while fealty to the sovereign was held a high virtue.
Hence the daily exhibitions of humble faithfulness,
the kneeling before the images of the monarch and
before their bishops, and the more substantial proof
of money gifts to both church and crown.<a name='FA_I-38' id='FA_I-38' href='#FN_I-38' class='fnanchor'>[I-38]</a>

<p>
The first efforts on behalf of emancipation were not
wholly lost, as they led to definitive results in the near
future. The next attempts also met with failure, and
brought upon their authors the heavy hand of Bustamante.
The first one, in 1813, was known as the
Betlen conspiracy, which derived its name from the
convent where the conspirators usually assembled.
Much importance was given to this affair by the government
and the loyalists. The meetings were presided
over by the sub-prior Fray Ramon de la Concepcion,
and were sometimes held in his cell, and at
others in the house of Cayetano Bedoya, under the
direction of Tomás Ruiz, an Indian.<a name='FA_I-39' id='FA_I-39' href='#FN_I-39' class='fnanchor'>[I-39]</a> All were sworn
to secrecy, and yet the government suspected the
plot, and arrested some persons who had the weakness
to divulge the plan and the names of their associates.<a name='FA_I-40' id='FA_I-40' href='#FN_I-40' class='fnanchor'>[I-40]</a>
</p>

<p>
The conspirators, all of whom were men of character
and good standing, soon found themselves in prison,
excepting José Francisco Barrundia, who remained
concealed six years, and afterward was one of the
most prominent statesmen of Central America. Major
Antonio del Villar was commissioned fiscal to
prosecute the prisoners. He spared no one in his
charges, and managed to bring into the meshes of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_19' name='Page_19' href='#Page_19'>19</a></span>
prosecution several persons who were innocent.<a name='FA_I-41' id='FA_I-41' href='#FN_I-41' class='fnanchor'>[I-41]</a> On
the 18th of September, 1814, he asked the military
court for the penalty of death, by garrote, against
Ruiz, Víctor Castrillo, José Francisco Barrundia pro
contumacia, and Joaquin Yúdice, who were hidalgos;
and the same penalty, by hanging, against the sub-prior
and ten others who were plebeians.<a name='FA_I-42' id='FA_I-42' href='#FN_I-42' class='fnanchor'>[I-42]</a> Ten years
of hard labor in the chain-gang of the African possessions,
and a life exile from America, were pronounced
upon others against whom no guilt was proved. The
prisoners were all set free, however, in 1819, under a
royal order of the 28th of July, 1817.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
THE PLOT OF BETLEN.
</p>

<p>
Among the men regarded as the most dangerous,
and strongly suspected of being the real managers of
the Betlen plot, was Mateo Antonio Marure, who
had been confined two years in a dungeon for the
part he took in the disturbances of 1811.<a name='FA_I-43' id='FA_I-43' href='#FN_I-43' class='fnanchor'>[I-43]</a> Bustamante
dreaded his presence in Guatemala, and in
1814 despatched him as a prisoner to the supreme
council of regency in Spain, with his reasons for this
measure. After recounting the Betlen affair, and
naming Marure as the real instigator and manager of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_20' name='Page_20' href='#Page_20'>20</a></span>
it, he adds that the conspirators counted on him as a
fearless man to carry it out, and that his bold language
and writings rendered his sojourn in America a constant
menace to Spanish interests.
</p>

<p>
Another and a worse planned attempt at revolution
than the one of 1811 occurred in Salvador in 1814.
The government quelled it, and the promoters were
arrested, Manuel José Arce suffering an imprisonment
of several years.<a name='FA_I-44' id='FA_I-44' href='#FN_I-44' class='fnanchor'>[I-44]</a>

<p class="p2">
The reader's attention is now called to matters concerning
the capitanía general of Guatemala, which
occupied the government both here and in Europe
immediately before King Fernando's coup-d'état.
</p>

<p>
Bustamante, evidently hostile to constitutional government,
and loath to suffer readily any curtailment
of his quasi-autocratic powers, proclaimed, under the
pressure of necessity, the national constitution, and
permitted elections under it; but between this and
allowing the diputaciones provinciales and ayuntamientos
free action under the fundamental law, there
was a wide chasm. He had no intention of tamely
submitting to such innovations, whatever might be
said of their merits in the abstract. In the first
place, he postponed for three whole months the installation
of the diputacion, and when it was installed,
refused to honor the event with a high mass and te
deum, which would have been the proper thing to do.
Such a recognition of the importance of the diputacion
might have shaken the faith of the populace in a
one-man power. He next insisted on the diputacion
having its sittings at the government house, where it
would be at his mercy. He treated the body disrespectfully
in several ways,<a name='FA_I-45' id='FA_I-45' href='#FN_I-45' class='fnanchor'>[I-45]</a> and as he could not make
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
it subservient to his will, tried by all means in his
power to destroy its influence and usefulness. In fact,
he looked upon it as a mere consultative corporation,
whose advice he might ask for or not, as suited his
fancy. Lastly, he would not permit the acts of the
diputacion to be published; and for the matter of
that, there was no liberty of the press.

córtes<a name='FA_I-46' id='FA_I-46' href='#FN_I-46' class='fnanchor'>[I-46]</a> for redress, coupled with a petition that the
royal authority should remove Bustamante from office.
But grievances were unredressed, and their author
continued wielding power in the country several years
more. Indeed, this was not to be wondered at. The
Spanish government had rarely, if ever, shown inclination
to do justice to the ruled against the high
rulers it placed over them, or to punish the despotic
acts of the latter. Residencias had of late become
mere matters of form. If the complainants had
wealth and influence at court, they might obtain the
recall of the ruler obnoxious to them, but no other
punishment. The prestige of authority must be upheld;
such was the principle acted upon.<a name='FA_I-47' id='FA_I-47' href='#FN_I-47' class='fnanchor'>[I-47]</a> Guatemala
was finally relieved of Bustamante's hated rule
on the 28th of March, 1818.
</p>

<p>
The people of Central America, like the rest of the
Spanish dominions, were soon invited to another view
in the political kaleidoscope. Fernando VII., upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
his release by Napoleon a few months after the treaty
of Valençay,<a name='FA_I-48' id='FA_I-48' href='#FN_I-48' class='fnanchor'>[I-48]</a> returned to Spain without delay, and
on arriving at Valencia, issued his manifesto of May
4, 1814, setting aside the constitution, and assuming
the authority of an absolute sovereign. He did this
with fair promises, which he carried out when and
how it suited him.<a name='FA_I-49' id='FA_I-49' href='#FN_I-49' class='fnanchor'>[I-49]</a> Among many decrees issued by
the monarch soon after, which were of interest to
Central America, was one enjoining on the archbishop
and bishops to see that their subordinates did their
duty faithfully, and entertained only wholesome
opinions. No associations or leagues were to be
tolerated which might lead to a disturbance of the
public peace; in other words, liberty and constitutional
government were not to be thought of.<a name='FA_I-50' id='FA_I-50' href='#FN_I-50' class='fnanchor'>[I-50]</a> Another
decree of June 17th, demanded of the deputies from
America having in their possession petitions from
their constituents to lay them before the royal government,
in order that they might be acted upon.
Several measures for the protection of morals and the
advancement of civilization were also enacted.

<p>
Successor to Bustamante in the position of governor,
president, and captain-general, in March 1818,
was Lieutenant-general Cárlos Urrutia,<a name='FA_II-1' id='FA_II-1' href='#FN_II-1' class='fnanchor'>[II-1]</a> knight grand
cross of the military order of San Hermenegildo,
which entitled him to be called <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">excelentísimo señor</span>.
It was a difficult position. The country was at peace,
it is true, but a political volcano was at work, and no
one could foretell when the upheaval of revolution
might occur,<a name='FA_II-2' id='FA_II-2' href='#FN_II-2' class='fnanchor'>[II-2]</a> letting loose the elements of destruction,
as had happened in other parts of Spanish America.
However, another constitutional term under the
Spanish monarch was about being inaugurated, and
this fact helped to bring on definitive results.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'>24</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Urrutia was a man of experience, with a well-balanced
mind, whose political opinions leaned to the
side of progress. He would have been well adapted
to guide the course of events in Central America had
it not been for the infirmities of old age. Guatemala,
being as yet under the sway of Spain, was open to
attack from the enemies of that government, or at
least, to such action as they might adopt in aid of the
disaffected portion of the people to secure their country's
independence. The latter was the plan of the
Colombian insurgents in fitting out a combined sea
and land expedition to operate against the ports of
Omoa and Trujillo in 1820.<a name='FA_II-3' id='FA_II-3' href='#FN_II-3' class='fnanchor'>[II-3]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ATTACK ON TRUJILLO.
</p>

<p>
On the 21st of April the watch-tower at Capiro,
in Trujillo, announced the approach of a Colombian
flotilla of small vessels from the windward. The garrison,
commanded by José M. Palomar, at once made
preparations for emergencies. The flotilla, consisting
of two brigantines, four large and as many small
schooners, one felucca, and one sloop, under Commodore
Aury, sailed in at two o'clock,<a name='FA_II-4' id='FA_II-4' href='#FN_II-4' class='fnanchor'>[II-4]</a> and despatched
a boat to shore to demand the surrender of the place
within one hour. Nothing further was done on that
day, however; but early the next morning the flotilla
moved toward the mouth of the Guaimoreto, and after
reconnoitering the defences, opened a bombardment
with ball and grape-shot on the intrenchment and
demolished it, which compelled the defenders to fall
back. The assailants landed 400 men and 15 horses,
and advanced against the garrison, meeting with a
repulse at the fourth parapet. The garrison retreated
to the fifth line, at which the enemy was a second
time driven back. The vessels fired broadside upon
broadside on the shore batteries, which were warmly
returned. The bombardment was kept up from nine
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
<span class="smcap">a. m.</span> till two <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>, when the flotilla retired out of reach
of the batteries. A portion of the land force then
attempted to enter the town by the rear of it, but
was detected and compelled to retire. Early in the
morning of the 23d, the invading troops returned to
the vessels, leaving their horses; and soon afterward
the flotilla put to sea, each vessel firing a broadside,
on passing Point Castilla, against the watch-tower.
During the night of the 24th the Colombian vessels
dropped out of sight.<a name='FA_II-5' id='FA_II-5' href='#FN_II-5' class='fnanchor'>[II-5]</a> On the 25th the flotilla appeared
off Omoa, and for several days was making
attempts to effect a landing, which being unsuccessful,
it retired on the 6th of May, after setting fire to the
larger brig, which had been damaged by the fire from
the town.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Fernando VII., under compulsion, restored the constitution
of 1812 throughout his dominions. On the
9th of March, 1820, he swore to support it, and the
next day issued a manifesto conveying an apology for
having set it aside in 1814, and giving plausible reasons
for his present change of mind. On the 11th of April
he issued another manifesto, addressed to the people
of America, expressing sorrow at not having sooner
reinstated the constitutional government. In another
decree of April 15th he restores to full force and vigor
all decrees of the córtes, both the extraordinary and
ordinary, for the better government and progress of
the provinces in America.
</p>

<p>
It seems that Brigadier Gavino Gainza, appointed
sub-inspector-general of the forces in Central America,
was commissioned to bring out the royal proclamations
and decrees for the reinstatement of the constitution,
and of the laws which were passed under it by the
córtes. There is nothing to show the precise time of
his arrival in Guatemala, but it will suffice to state
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_26' name='Page_26' href='#Page_26'>26</a></span>
that the diputacion provincial was installed at the
capital on the 13th of July.
</p>

<p>
At a preparatory sitting of the córtes, on the 26th
of June, 1820, Juan N. San Juan and José Sacasa
were present as representatives from Guatemala, and
on the 2d of August Juan N. Tuero, or Fuero, presented
his credentials as a deputy elected from Chiapas
for the córtes of 1815-16, which body he found
closed on arriving in Spain at the end of 1814.<a name='FA_II-6' id='FA_II-6' href='#FN_II-6' class='fnanchor'>[II-6]</a> The
necessity of such a diputacion was ably discussed in
the córtes on the 30th of April, 1821, by Deputy
Hermosilla, seconded by Deputy Milla, both supporting
the report of the committee on the subject. On
the 17th of June the chamber was officially informed
of the installation of the diputacion, and commended
its patriotic labors.<a name='FA_II-7' id='FA_II-7' href='#FN_II-7' class='fnanchor'>[II-7]</a>
</p>

<p>
The '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">junta suprema de censura,</span>' created to adjudicate
upon alleged offences against the law regulating
the press, had, on the 9th of August, 1820, nominated,
and the córtes confirmed, the members of the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">junta de censura</span> for Guatemala.<a name='FA_II-8' id='FA_II-8' href='#FN_II-8' class='fnanchor'>[II-8]</a>

BACOS AND CACOS.
</p>

<p>
The reëstablishment of the constitutional régime
under such favorable circumstances soon brought into
life two great parties that for a long time bore the respective
names of Gazista, or Baco, and Caco. The
gazista, with José del Valle as its leader,<a name='FA_II-9' id='FA_II-9' href='#FN_II-9' class='fnanchor'>[II-9]</a> was made
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
up of Spaniards and artisans. The cacos recognized
as their chieftain José María Delgado.<a name='FA_II-10' id='FA_II-10' href='#FN_II-10' class='fnanchor'>[II-10]</a> Their party
was composed of members of the nobility, and of the
men calling themselves independents. This party
from the first aspired to independence, and its candidates
were taken from the independent wing at the
election of deputies and other officials.
</p>

<p>
The gazistas, or bacos, were numerous and strong,
for they had in their ranks the rulers, many wealthy
merchants, and the artisans, and abundant funds at
command, which were scattered without stint among
the needy and ignorant, who were ready enough to
sell their votes.<a name='FA_II-11' id='FA_II-11' href='#FN_II-11' class='fnanchor'>[II-11]</a> They likewise strengthened their
influence with the lower class by means of a pretended
hostility to the aristocracy, or to what from
that time went by the name of '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">espíritu de familia.</span>'
They won the elections, but their triumph proved to
be far from a solid one.
</p>

<p>
The cacos now resolved to use every endeavor to
accomplish independence. The connection with the
aristocratic element was a drawback; and the absolute
necessity of winning over the mechanics being
recognized, a middle party was at once organized,
which attached itself to the independents, and would
have no connection with the nobles. This arrangement
facilitated the accomplishment of the object in
view.
</p>

<p>
The political struggle was now fairly inaugurated.
Pedro Molina<a name='FA_II-12' id='FA_II-12' href='#FN_II-12' class='fnanchor'>[II-12]</a> began the publication of <i>El Editor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_28' name='Page_28' href='#Page_28'>28</a></span>
Constitucional</i>, to defend American rights. The <i>Amigo
de la Patria</i> appeared at the same time, and often
opposed Molina's radical doctrines. Urrutia, now
styling himself jefe político y capitan general, made
an address to the people, congratulating them and
himself on the happy termination of the election in
the several parishes, and giving assurances that every
voter should have full liberty to cast his vote for representative
in the general congress, the diputacion, and
the ayuntamiento.<a name='FA_II-13' id='FA_II-13' href='#FN_II-13' class='fnanchor'>[II-13]</a> A portion of his address was
specially devoted to artisans and laboring men, whom
he warned not to allow themselves to be tampered
with to the discredit of the government on the question
of trade in cotton goods; for, he told them, it was
a positive misconception that the government had it
in view to decree freedom of foreign trade; on the
contrary, it had endeavored to check illegal traffic,
which had been carried on to the detriment of national
interests and the royal treasury.
</p>

<p>
The measures adopted by him had to some extent
corrected that evil. By making the traders pay import
dues, the treasury had profited, and the people
had been saved from new taxes. Formerly, English
goods were paid for wholly in coin; now, only one
sixth of their cost was covered with money, and the
remainder with the produce of the country.<a name='FA_II-14' id='FA_II-14' href='#FN_II-14' class='fnanchor'>[II-14]</a>

ARCHBISHOPS.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The first archbishop of Guatemala appointed by
the Spanish crown in the present century was Luis
Peñalver y Cárdenas,<a name='FA_II-17' id='FA_II-17' href='#FN_II-17' class='fnanchor'>[II-17]</a> who reached his see the 3d of
June, 1802, and on the 26th took possession. During
his brief incumbency he founded several rectorships,
and two primary schools for girls. His sight becoming
seriously affected, he relinquished the mitre,
and returned to his native city, secretly departing
March 1, 1806.<a name='FA_II-18' id='FA_II-18' href='#FN_II-18' class='fnanchor'>[II-18]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rafael de la Vara de la Madrid, Peñalver's successor,
arrived in Acajutla on the 13th of December,
1807; in Guatemala city on the 4th of January, 1808;
and on the 3d of February took possession of his
office. In April 1809 he visited the province of Vera
Paz, where he died on the 31st of December, much
regretted, as he had endeared himself by his peaceable
disposition and affability.<a name='FA_II-19' id='FA_II-19' href='#FN_II-19' class='fnanchor'>[II-19]</a>

The next and eighth archbishop of the diocese was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
Ramon Casaus y Torres, nominated by the supreme
council of regency on the 30th of March, 1811; who
entered the capital on the 30th of July, and being a consecrated
bishop, at once began to perform episcopal
functions.<a name='FA_II-20' id='FA_II-20' href='#FN_II-20' class='fnanchor'>[II-20]</a> His nomination was ratified by the king
on the 27th of August, 1814; the papal bulls of confirmation
were issued on the 15th of March, 1815, and
Casaus received the pallium on the 28th of September
of the same year.
</p>

<p class="p2">
At the sitting of the Spanish córtes on the 25th
of June, 1821, the American deputies laid before that
body a memorial setting forth the condition of their
provinces, and the measures which, in their opinion,
would lead to a definitive peace. They not only
assured their Spanish colleagues that Americans were
fully conscious of their rights as freemen, but also
of their determination and ability to defend them;
nevertheless, if those rights were respected, and justice
was done, existing difficulties might be obliterated.
They believed, however, that a constitutional system
would be impracticable in America, unless new and
efficacious measures were adopted to enable the
three branches of government to act freely within
their respective bounds, and likewise to make effective
the responsibility of public officials for their acts.
Another point upon which they laid stress was the
inutility of American deputies at the Spanish córtes
unless they were effectively upheld from their respective
countries. They found other faults with the existing
government, and declared that the solution of the
great problem would be found in the establishment
of autonomic governments in America.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
RIPE FOR INDEPENDENCE.
</p>

<p>
Commerce between Spanish America and the
mother country should be treated as internal trade,
the Americans having equal rights and privileges with
their brethren of Europe. The same equality in
respect to civil rights and appointment to office was
likewise to exist between the natives of America and
Spain. If such demands were conceded, Mexico and
Central America would pay to Spain ten million dollars
within six years, in yearly installments from January
1, 1823, to be applied to the cancelling of the
national debt. They would also allow Spain two
million dollars yearly for the support of the royal
navy.<a name='FA_II-21' id='FA_II-21' href='#FN_II-21' class='fnanchor'>[II-21]</a>
</p>

<p>
It was now too late, however, for conciliatory efforts
to be successful. Events crowded upon each other,
and were beyond the control even of the men who
made them. Central America was at peace, but the
constitutional system recently established, with its
popular elections and a free press, after the spirit of nationality
had gained so much ground, naturally tended
to excite the public mind, emboldening the timid, and
increasing the number of the friends of independence.
Party spirit controlled everything; it was felt even in
the domestic circle. The people were prepared and
anxious for a change, when vague rumors were set
afloat of renewed revolutionary efforts in Mexico.<a name='FA_II-22' id='FA_II-22' href='#FN_II-22' class='fnanchor'>[II-22]</a>
Party leaders were of one mind on the desirability of
separation. It was generally admitted that the subjection
of the country to Spain could no longer be
maintained. Only a few high officials and Spaniards
dissented. Now was the time, if ever, for a sound
head and strong hand to helm the ship of state. Urrutia,
owing to age and physical ailings, was not the
man for the occasion; nor was he, though opposed to
the scheme of secession, able to retard it. Under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
circumstances, the diputacion provincial prevailed on
the jefe superior político to delegate his powers to the
sub-inspector of the troops, Gavino Gainza.<a name='FA_II-23' id='FA_II-23' href='#FN_II-23' class='fnanchor'>[II-23]</a> This
officer at first tried to stem the torrent of revolution,
to act as the agent of Spain, disapproving the plan of
separation, but at the same time maintained intimate
relations with the independents and aided their efforts.
This party publicly circulated a paper for signatures
to ask Gainza to proclaim independence himself. He
pretended to be indignant; and upon the receipt
of the plan of Iguala, formed in Mexico by Iturbide
and Guerrero,<a name='FA_II-24' id='FA_II-24' href='#FN_II-24' class='fnanchor'>[II-24]</a> he issued a manifesto depicting it in
the blackest colors, and ordered that all who had
called on him to declare independence should be
prosecuted.<a name='FA_II-25' id='FA_II-25' href='#FN_II-25' class='fnanchor'>[II-25]</a> The independents became disgusted, but
had to make the best of the situation. They then
resolved to play upon his personal ambition, assuring
him that for his coöperation in their plans he would
be retained in command, and afterward chosen the
first chief magistrate of the young nation. While he
still hesitated, they despatched Cayetano Bedoya to
Oajaca for military aid from General Bravo. But on
the messenger's arrival at Ciudad Real de Chiapas,
he found that the place had followed the example of
Oajaca and Tehuantepec, accepting the plan of Iguala.
This step hastened events in Guatemala, and Bedoya
had no need of going farther.
</p>

<p>
The act of Ciudad Real, received September 13th,
caused the greatest excitement in the city of Guatemala,
and the government had to give way. Urged
by the diputacion, Gainza summoned, on the 14th, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
high officials and other notables to a meeting next
day to resolve on some action responsive to the demands
of the people.<a name='FA_II-26' id='FA_II-26' href='#FN_II-26' class='fnanchor'>[II-26]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
GAINZA'S MEETING.
</p>

<p>
During the night of the 14th Molina and the cacos
scattered their agents throughout the wards to stir
up the masses, and at the same time to awe the españolistas,
or royal partisans. At 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> on the 15th
a throng of independents filled the porticos, court-yard,
halls, and ante-chambers of the government house.
Among them and instructing the crowds were Molina,
Barrundia, Basilio Porras, and other leaders. Soon
after began to arrive at the government house the
officials called to take part in the deliberations of the
meeting, namely, two members of each corporation
deputized therefor; the archbishop and prelates of
the religious orders; the chief officers of the army and
treasury; who, together with the diputacion provincial,
and under the presidency of the acting jefe superior
político, Gainza,<a name='FA_II-27' id='FA_II-27' href='#FN_II-27' class='fnanchor'>[II-27]</a> at once proceeded to business.
After reading the declarations in Chiapas, several members
briefly expressed their views. The first speaker
was Valle, leader of the gazistas, who eloquently advocated
independence as necessary and just, but ended
advising that it should not be proclaimed till the other
sections had formally declared in its favor. The
motion was seconded. The anti-independents<a name='FA_II-28' id='FA_II-28' href='#FN_II-28' class='fnanchor'>[II-28]</a> opposed
all action until final results in Mexico should be
received. Every attempt at a vacillating policy was
defeated by the energetic efforts of the independents,
who voted for an immediate declaration of independence.<a name='FA_II-29' id='FA_II-29' href='#FN_II-29' class='fnanchor'>[II-29]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
Every vote favorable to independence was
received by the people with loud applause, and every
one against it with groans. The popular preference
became so marked and boisterous that the anti-independents,
fearing for their lives, retired from the
palace.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PROCLAMATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
</p>

<p>
The diputacion and ayuntamiento then, as the legitimate
organs to express the public will, drew up the
Acta de Independencia, which was adopted, signed,
and sworn to by all the members present.<a name='FA_II-30' id='FA_II-30' href='#FN_II-30' class='fnanchor'>[II-30]</a> This
instrument, after declaring the aspiration of Guatemalans
to be a free and independent people,<a name='FA_II-31' id='FA_II-31' href='#FN_II-31' class='fnanchor'>[II-31]</a> invited
all citizens of the provinces to choose without delay
representatives, on the basis of one for every 15,000
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
inhabitants, to a national congress that was to meet
March 1, 1822. In the mean time the Spanish laws,
courts of justice, and public functionaries were to continue
as heretofore. The representatives were to be
chosen by the same <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">juntas electorales</span> that had lately,
since the restoration of the constitution, elected deputies
to the córtes, without excluding, as the constitution
did, men of African descent from the rights of
full citizenship.<a name='FA_II-32' id='FA_II-32' href='#FN_II-32' class='fnanchor'>[II-32]</a> The clause giving the last electoral
college, with its majority of Valle's partisans, the

is said to have been inserted in the acta by
himself.<a name='FA_II-33' id='FA_II-33' href='#FN_II-33' class='fnanchor'>[II-33]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the 17th Gainza issued a proclamation formally
placing before the people the resolutions adopted on
the 15th, and enjoining on all the duty of abiding by
them, and of respecting the laws and authorities
recognized by them. Any attempt, by word or deed,
to restore Spanish domination was declared high
treason, punishable with death.<a name='FA_II-34' id='FA_II-34' href='#FN_II-34' class='fnanchor'>[II-34]</a> The powers of the
congress would be constituent to adopt a form of government
and frame the national constitution. Meantime
Gainza held civil and military authority, acting
with the advice of a provisional junta consultiva,
formed with the diputacion provincial and seven
additional members, representing respectively Leon,
Comayagua, Costa Rica, Quezaltenango, Sololá, Chimaltenango,
Sonsonate, and Ciudad Real.<a name='FA_II-35' id='FA_II-35' href='#FN_II-35' class='fnanchor'>[II-35]</a> Neither
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
the people at large nor the meeting of the 15th created
such a body. It was the creation of the men who
remained behind in the hall, including Valle, who
drew up the acta.<a name='FA_II-36' id='FA_II-36' href='#FN_II-36' class='fnanchor'>[II-36]</a> Continuing his double dealing,
Gainza had issued his proclamation, on the 16th, for
the election of representatives to congress. He spoke
therein of the longing for independence since 1810, of
the popular love for the cause which had been so
forcibly sustained at the meeting of the preceding day,
and concluded by inviting the whole people to approve
the plan, and to appoint their deputies to complete
the work.

Before proceeding further with the political situation
at the capital of Guatemala, I will devote a little
space to laying before the reader some information on
one of its most important sections, namely, Chiapas.
The population was computed in 1813 at over 100,000
inhabitants, of whom 70,000 were Indians; the remainder
were Spaniards and mixed breeds, with a
few negroes.<a name='FA_II-37' id='FA_II-37' href='#FN_II-37' class='fnanchor'>[II-37]</a>
</p>

<p>
As a reward for good services and generous pecuniary
contributions to the nation, the Spanish córtes
passed, October 29, 1813, a decree bestowing the title
of city on the town of Comitan, and that of villa on
those of Tusta, Tonalá, Tapachula, and Palenque.<a name='FA_II-38' id='FA_II-38' href='#FN_II-38' class='fnanchor'>[II-38]</a>

THE SUBDELEGADOS.
</p>

<p>
In contravention of law, the first name of the three
proposed by the intendente to the president of Guatemala,
for chief of each of the eleven subdelegaciones,
was that of some creature of the intendente. Unfitness
for the place or immorality counted for nothing
if the nomination suited the proposer or the confirming
power. These subdelegados, by means of their
comisarios, collected the tribute and speculated with
it; each being a tyrant who oppressed the Indians at
his will.
</p>

<p>
Education was neglected; ignorance prevailed to
such an extent that a large portion of the inhabitants
did not know even the first rudiments of their religion.
The poorer Spaniards and the mixed breeds
were entirely without education. Indeed, in nearly
three centuries, not only had the Indians not learned
to speak Spanish, but the native Spaniards spoke
the six Indian tongues of the province better than
their own.<a name='FA_II-39' id='FA_II-39' href='#FN_II-39' class='fnanchor'>[II-39]</a>
</p>

<p>
Chiapas, it is well known, had been an episcopal see,
with its cathedral at Ciudad Real, since the first years
of the conquest.<a name='FA_II-40' id='FA_II-40' href='#FN_II-40' class='fnanchor'>[II-40]</a> The country is fertile and well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
watered. Its agricultural products were wheat—of
which there was a surplus for exportation—maize,
beans, rice, coffee, and cacao.<a name='FA_II-41' id='FA_II-41' href='#FN_II-41' class='fnanchor'>[II-41]</a> A variety of vegetables
in abundance, and the fruits of all climes, could
also be obtained. The maguey was extensively cultivated
for pulque and aguardiente. A great deal of
sugar-cane and good tobacco were grown. Indigo
and cochineal were cultivated to some extent. The
country had likewise excellent grazing. Cattle, sheep,
goats, horses, and mules abounded. The mines of
gold, silver, lead, copper, and iron were not worked,
owing to the poverty of the inhabitants. The governor-intendente
of Chiapas in 1817, Cárlos Castañon,
as appears in the records, was a confirmed
royalist.<a name='FA_II-42' id='FA_II-42' href='#FN_II-42' class='fnanchor'>[II-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
From the time that Iturbide proclaimed the independence
of Mexico, the canons of the chapter in the
diocese of Ciudad Real—bitterly hostile, like the majority
of the Mexican and Central American clergy,
to the reforms of the Spanish córtes respecting the
church<a name='FA_II-43' id='FA_II-43' href='#FN_II-43' class='fnanchor'>[II-43]</a>—had been in communication with that chieftain's
auditor de guerra, Fernandez Almansa, who
kept them informed on the progress of the revolution.
The clericals looked upon the Mexican chief as the
savior of their ancient prerogatives and monopolies,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
and with this end in view, prepared public opinion
for setting aside the authority of Fernando VII.

CHIAPAS ACCEPTS ITURBIDE.
</p>

<p>
The governor-intendente, Juan N. Batres, together
with the ayuntamiento of Ciudad Real, proclaimed,
on the 3d of September, 1821, the separation of Chiapas
from Spain, and her acceptance of Iturbide's plan of
Iguala. On the 8th all the authorities and officers,
civil and military, took the oath to support that act,
which was administered by the governor of the diocese;
after which they had high mass and a sermon
in the cathedral, where the secular clergy and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
people took the same oath<a name='FA_II-45' id='FA_II-45' href='#FN_II-45' class='fnanchor'>[II-45]</a> before the aforesaid ecclesiastic
authority. The obligations assumed were
to support the Roman catholic apostolic religion; to
secure the independence of the empire, preserving to
that end peace and union between Europeans and
Americans; and to obey Fernando VII., should he
adopt and swear to support the constitution to be
enacted by the córtes of the Mexican empire. Chiapas
was, therefore, the first province of the captain-generalcy
of Guatemala to throw off the Spanish yoke;
she at the same time separated herself from Guatemala,
and manifested her determination to link her
future with Mexico. All this was made known September
21st by the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">comandante-general</span> of Oajaca to
Iturbide. The example of Ciudad Real was unhesitatingly
followed by the other towns in the province.
</p>

<p>
We have seen that Guatemala, at her declaration of
independence, did not at once accept annexation to
the Mexican empire. This course did not suit the
rulers and notables of Ciudad Real, who hastened
to manifest their displeasure at a meeting held September
20th, and attended by the intendente, ayuntamiento,
and other official bodies, prelates, and a
large number of citizens.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
CHIAPAS A PART OF MEXICO.
</p>

<p>
As a matter of fact, the desire of Chiapas to be
detached from Guatemala and annexed to Mexico
existed with some strength even before the declaration
of independence;<a name='FA_II-46' id='FA_II-46' href='#FN_II-46' class='fnanchor'>[II-46]</a> and Guatemala having failed
to return an answer to the letter from the authorities
of Chiapas, announcing her action of the 3d, this
neglect had strengthened the notables of the latter
in their resolution to recognize no other government
than that of the Mexican empire under the treaties of
Córdoba. It was also resolved at the meeting not to
circulate the declaration of independence which the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_41' name='Page_41' href='#Page_41'>41</a></span>
jefe político of Guatemala had sent. These sentiments
were duly seconded by the other cities and
towns.
</p>

<p>
In order to guard against any action Guatemala
might take because of the course of Chiapas, at a
formal session of the diputacion, presided over by the
jefe político, and held on the 22d of October, it was
resolved to send to Mexico a commissioner to take the
necessary steps, and procure his province's separation
from Guatemala, even if the latter should come to be
thereafter a part of the Mexican empire.<a name='FA_II-47' id='FA_II-47' href='#FN_II-47' class='fnanchor'>[II-47]</a>

<p>
Among the first acts of the junta at Guatemala
was the promotion of two officers who were supposed
to be reliable supporters of the late movement.<a name='FA_III-1' id='FA_III-1' href='#FN_III-1' class='fnanchor'>[III-1]</a> Both
proved themselves afterward recreant to their pledges,
by their hostility to the republican cause.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PARTY STRIFE.
</p>

<p>
The cacos were republicans. They strove to rid
the country of the antiquated errors and practices,
including in their plans the abolishment of the privileges
of the clergy, and the restriction of their power,
which had been a constant source of injury to the
people at large. They wanted the adoption of democratic
institutions, in order to place the masses on the
level heretofore occupied only by the ruling class.
They succeeded in prevailing on the people to take an
interest and a direct intervention in public affairs.
Barrundia, Molina, and Córdoba led them to the galleries
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_43' name='Page_43' href='#Page_43'>43</a></span>
of the junta chamber to witness its acts, and
even take part in its deliberations.<a name='FA_III-2' id='FA_III-2' href='#FN_III-2' class='fnanchor'>[III-2]</a> They attacked
Valle for the clause he inserted in the acta of the
15th, to which I have alluded in the preceding chapter.
On that point they certainly had a well-founded
grievance, but their manner of presenting it resulted
in a loss of confidence in the junta, the organization
of new parties, and general distraction. The point
taken by them, however, was decided in their favor
by the junta. But the latter held secret sessions
after the 29th of September, significant of sinister
purposes.
</p>

<p>
The other party—formerly constituting the ruling
class—scouted the idea of equality. Most of the
churchmen had the same feeling; for in joining the
movement for separation from Spain their motive had
been to shield their menaced prerogatives, rather than
love for America or freedom.
</p>

<p>
On the 18th of September Gainza wrote Iturbide,
generalissimo of the so-called empire of Mexico, that
his course had been hailed with joy, and that political
parties had consolidated on the proposition of independence
from Spain; hence he had proclaimed it.
And that, since then, amid the transition from one
system to another, the minds of the people of Guatemala
had been fixed on Iturbide, and they had
desired to tender him their congratulations as the
liberator of New Spain.<a name='FA_III-3' id='FA_III-3' href='#FN_III-3' class='fnanchor'>[III-3]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The junta consultiva passed a number of decrees,
which were sanctioned by Gainza. Urrutia, the ex-captain-general,
was tendered his salary and the considerations
due his rank and former office if he would
formally recognize the independence.<a name='FA_III-4' id='FA_III-4' href='#FN_III-4' class='fnanchor'>[III-4]</a> He declined
with thanks, departing for Habana soon after. At
the time of the adoption of the acta, peaceable persons
were assured of protection to their persons and
property, which pledge was faithfully fulfilled. No
opponent of independence was molested. Officials
desirous of returning to their country were allowed
to do so.<a name='FA_III-5' id='FA_III-5' href='#FN_III-5' class='fnanchor'>[III-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
The junta, which bore the compellation of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">excelentísima</span>,
unanimously appointed Gainza captain-general,
with the salary of $10,000 a year, decorating him also
with a three-colored scarf, commemorative of the
three guarantees. A gold medal was voted to the
members of the ayuntamiento, who made the solemn
declaration of independence on the 23d of September.<a name='FA_III-6' id='FA_III-6' href='#FN_III-6' class='fnanchor'>[III-6]</a>
Committees were next appointed to study and report
to the junta on public instruction, safety and defences,
statistics, industry, and finances. José del
Valle was instructed to form a plan of government.<a name='FA_III-7' id='FA_III-7' href='#FN_III-7' class='fnanchor'>[III-7]</a>
</p>

<p>
Several financial measures engaged the attention
of the junta. One of them proposed to levy a duty
of ten per centum on gold and silver exported to
Spain. This was never strictly enforced. Restrictions
to foreign commerce, and monopolies existing
under the Spanish government, were abolished. Liberal
principles were introduced, including freedom of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'>45</a></span>

constitution, and was now continued in force.<a name='FA_III-8' id='FA_III-8' href='#FN_III-8' class='fnanchor'>[III-8]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
SALVADOR INDEPENDENT.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In Salvador absolute independence had been declared
by the ayuntamiento on the 21st of September,
and proclaimed eight days after. Pedro Barriere,
who as <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">teniente letrado</span> was temporarily acting as chief
civil authority, together with the ayuntamiento of
San Salvador, decreed the election of seven persons
to form a "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">junta subalterna económica y consultiva.</span>"
There was great commotion stirred on the one hand
by the vicar Ignacio Saldaña, and on the other by the
liberals, Arce, Ramirez, and others. The next day,
the people being assembled to effect the election,
Barriere, pretending that his friends, the so-called
serviles, were in peril, retracted his former action.
His words enraged the populace. Then he called
out the troops to disperse the crowds, and arrested the
republican leaders Arce, Rodriguez, and Domingo
Lara.<a name='FA_III-9' id='FA_III-9' href='#FN_III-9' class='fnanchor'>[III-9]</a> But on the news of his course reaching Guatemala,
Delgado was despatched to Salvador as a peace-maker,
clothed with ample powers. On his way to
the capital he liberated prisoners, all of whom joined
his following and entered the city with him. Barriere
was sent out of the province; the troops were
disarmed; peace was restored; a subordinate junta
consultiva was installed, and Delgado continued at
the head of the government.<a name='FA_III-10' id='FA_III-10' href='#FN_III-10' class='fnanchor'>[III-10]</a>

<p>
In Honduras, on the receipt at Comayagua of the
news that Guatemala had seceded from the Spanish
crown, the governor-intendente, Brigadier José Tinoco
de Contreras, and the diputacion<a name='FA_III-11' id='FA_III-11' href='#FN_III-11' class='fnanchor'>[III-11]</a> refused to
recognize the government constituted in that city, and
took an oath to support the plan of Iguala. This
was a virtual annexation of Honduras to the Mexican
empire. The partidos of Tegucigalpa and Gracias,
and the ports of Omoa and Trujillo, would not accept
as valid the act of the authorities at Comayagua, and
maintained relations with those in Guatemala. The
independence from Spain had been declared on the
16th of October.

Tinoco took the two ports above named, which were
treacherously surrendered to him.<a name='FA_III-12' id='FA_III-12' href='#FN_III-12' class='fnanchor'>[III-12]</a> He also fitted
out a force to march on Tegucigalpa. A counter-revolution,

LIBERTY IN NICARAGUA.
</p>

<p>
Nicaragua had, since 1813, a diputacion provincial,
under the decree of the Spanish córtes of May 24,
1812. Its jurisdiction extended over the districts of
Leon, Granada, Segovia, Nicaragua, and Matagalpa.
Under the new system, established in 1821, and since
Urrutia's retirement, constant questions of jurisdiction
arose between the intendente and the superior
jefe político.<a name='FA_III-14' id='FA_III-14' href='#FN_III-14' class='fnanchor'>[III-14]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the 3d of October Colonel Crisanto Sacasa,
commandant at Granada, issued a general order to
the officers to report with their troops next morning,
and take the oath to support national independence,
pursuant to the instructions he had received from
Captain-general Gainza. Intendente Saravia had
been at enmity with Gainza, and when the first steps
were taken in Guatemala for independence, he threw
off his authority. In this he had the aid of Bishop
Jerez and Colonel Joaquin Arechavala, commander
of the militia, all three being natives of old Spain.
They induced the diputacion and the ayuntamiento,
by an act of the 11th of October, to declare Nicaragua
seceded from Guatemala.<a name='FA_III-15' id='FA_III-15' href='#FN_III-15' class='fnanchor'>[III-15]</a> This action occurred
in Leon. But Granada refused to concur, and sent
its representatives to the congress called to meet in
Guatemala. Later, October 21st, the authorities in
Leon formally accepted the Iguala plan, thereby annexing
the whole province to the Mexican empire.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
The country was accordingly divided into two antagonistic
parties, the imperialist and the republican.<a name='FA_III-16' id='FA_III-16' href='#FN_III-16' class='fnanchor'>[III-16]</a>
</p>

<p>
Gainza said to the diputacion at Leon, on the 22d
of October, that neither they nor the junta consultiva,
nor any other body of men then existing, could decide
upon the future of the country; none had a legal right
to declare for or against annexation to Mexico. This
could be arrived at only by the representatives of the
people in the general congress.<a name='FA_III-17' id='FA_III-17' href='#FN_III-17' class='fnanchor'>[III-17]</a> He appointed Colonel
Sacasa comandante general of the forces in Nicaragua,
and directed him to install in Granada a subordinate
junta gubernativa of five members, clothed with the
functions of a jefe político, and which was to continue
in power till the status of the country should be
fixed.<a name='FA_III-18' id='FA_III-18' href='#FN_III-18' class='fnanchor'>[III-18]</a> Sacasa frankly notified the rulers in Leon of
what he was to do, and took steps to carry his orders
into execution. But Saravia, with the bishop and
the diputacion, determined that no such junta should
be installed. The diputacion, on the 1st of December,
by a special act, forbade its organization, declaring
all attempts toward it subversive of good order
and hostile to the Mexican empire, to which they
owed allegiance; and warning all citizens to abstain
from such efforts.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_49' name='Page_49' href='#Page_49'>49</a></span>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
COSTA RICA NEUTRAL.
</p>

<p>
Sacasa had every right to expect that Gainza would
support him against attacks from Leon, but he was
disappointed. The captain-general wrote him, on the
22d of December, that it was doubtful if Central
America could maintain a government separate from
Mexico, many towns having already attached themselves
to the empire; and that he had expressed the
same opinion to Saravia. Whereupon Sacasa, though
a republican, made no further opposition to the powers
at Leon.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Costa Rica was privileged by distance to keep aloof
from political troubles threatening the other provinces.
She had seceded from Spain on the 27th of October,
and set aside the governor, Juan Cañas; but when
called upon to adopt the plan of the capital or that of
Leon, she declined both, preferring a neutral attitude.<a name='FA_III-19' id='FA_III-19' href='#FN_III-19' class='fnanchor'>[III-19]</a>
A meeting of notables confirmed the act of secession,
and set up a provisional government entirely detached
from that at Leon, which was to reside alternately in
Cartago, San José, Heredia, and Alajuela. But this
was found inconvenient, owing to rivalries between
the two first-named towns; and finally it was decided,
on the 27th of November, to place public affairs in
the hands of Manuel Peralta, Rafael Osejo, and Hermenegildo
Bonilla, who were to reside at the provincial
capital, Cartago. Under this arrangement peace
was preserved, and the province never was really under
the imperial rule.<a name='FA_III-20' id='FA_III-20' href='#FN_III-20' class='fnanchor'>[III-20]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Dissensions had now brought the country to the
brink of civil war, and no time was to be lost in averting
it. Measures were adopted to hasten the meeting
of congress. With the view of restoring peace between
the sections, and of rendering harmless disturbing elements
without resort to arms, the junta at Guatemala
concluded to despatch trusty commissioners to the
provinces where secession was rife, who were to prevail
on them to send deputies to the general congress.
Other agents were to be despatched to Mexico to
watch the turn of events at the capital.<a name='FA_III-21' id='FA_III-21' href='#FN_III-21' class='fnanchor'>[III-21]</a> What
good results those agents might have accomplished, it
is impossible now to say. They had no occasion to
try their efforts. Events in Mexico succeeded one
another with such rapidity, and their influence on
Central America was so powerful, that, even among
the best patriots, many made up their minds to coöperate
toward the union, carried away by the idea that
only under the ægis of the northern empire could
peace, safety, and stability be secured.
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica, we have seen, was in fact out of the
field; at any rate, it had no share in the political strife.
The provinces of Guatemala proper and Salvador
were the only ones, at present, which together with
Granada, in Nicaragua, and some portions of Honduras,
attempted to preserve an independence from
Mexico under whatever form of government might be
adopted in that country. The idea of annexation to
Mexico had been, however, growing popular from day
to day in Guatemala. The important section of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_51' name='Page_51' href='#Page_51'>51</a></span>
Quezaltenango adhered to the scheme, on the 13th of
November, inviting Suchitepequez, Sololá, and Antigua
Guatemala to follow the example, which they
did soon after. And Cirilo Flores and Antonio Corzo,
who in later years figured as most prominent champions
of democracy and suffered martyrdom for their
cause, then supported the action of Quezaltenango.
</p>

<p>
It was contended that Central America, after throwing
off the Spanish yoke, acquired, with independence,
the right of forming such associations as might be
mutually beneficial. This doctrine was warmly advocated
by a large portion of the reflecting class.
Under such circumstances, Guatemala and Salvador,
hemmed in as they were between provinces that had
already become annexed to Mexico, could not maintain
an absolute independence.

<p class="sidenote">
ITURBIDE'S EFFORTS.
</p>

<p>
Iturbide had large ideas of imperial sway, and was
bent on the acquisition of entire Central America,
aided efficiently, as he was on this side, by the aristocrats
and other dissentient elements, who, perceiving
the insignificance they would come to if the nation
finally became constituted under a democratic government,
which their opponents were aiming at, labored
with might and main to defeat the plan.<a name='FA_III-22' id='FA_III-22' href='#FN_III-22' class='fnanchor'>[III-22]</a> They won
over with money and fair promises a part of the people,
and with Gainza, who expected high rank and
offices from the new empire, bound Central America
hand and foot, as will hereafter be seen.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_52' name='Page_52' href='#Page_52'>52</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The junta consultiva was much perplexed in view
of the situation. The imperialists daily became more
insolent and exacting. At this critical time—November
28th—Gainza laid before it a letter<a name='FA_III-23' id='FA_III-23' href='#FN_III-23' class='fnanchor'>[III-23]</a> from the
generalissimo, making allusion to the much abused
second article of the acta de independencia, and declaring
that Guatemala was not able to occupy as yet
a place in the family of nations, and should therefore
link her fate with Mexico.<a name='FA_III-24' id='FA_III-24' href='#FN_III-24' class='fnanchor'>[III-24]</a> Whereupon the junta,
at the suggestion of the marqués de Aycinena, hastily
answered that the popular wishes must be ascertained
before adopting any action; promising to send the proposal
at once to the ayuntamientos and local authorities,
with instructions to call on the people to give a
formal expression of their will on the subject. This
promise was kept in a measure—the ayuntamientos,
not the people, were given one month's time to manifest
their preference.<a name='FA_III-25' id='FA_III-25' href='#FN_III-25' class='fnanchor'>[III-25]</a>
</p>

<p>
Soon after the arrival of Iturbide's messenger, the
persecution of republicans was begun. The rough
element of the population, instigated by their adversaries,
during the night insulted them at their homes.<a name='FA_III-26' id='FA_III-26' href='#FN_III-26' class='fnanchor'>[III-26]</a>
Any one who either by word or writing opposed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_53' name='Page_53' href='#Page_53'>53</a></span>
plan of annexation was treated as seditious. At last
the opposing parties had a scuffle in the streets, on
the night of November 30th, which ended in the discomfiture
of the republicans engaged in it.<a name='FA_III-27' id='FA_III-27' href='#FN_III-27' class='fnanchor'>[III-27]</a> Barrundia
and Molina were present and exhibited much
energy. The latter was in great peril of losing his
life.

VOTE OF THE AYUNTAMIENTOS.
</p>

<p>
On the day appointed for the receipt of the returns
from the several ayuntamientos—namely, the 31st of
December—the junta provisional consultiva proceeded
to the count. The result was as follows: 21 ayuntamientos
declared that none but the general congress
had authority to decide for or against the union with
Mexico; 104 favored the annexation at once and
unconditionally; 11 approved of the union, provided
certain terms, which they appended, were stipulated
in the act of incorporation; 32 left the matter wholly

connection in toto.<a name='FA_III-28' id='FA_III-28' href='#FN_III-28' class='fnanchor'>[III-28]</a> Many others had not, for some

the appointed day. The result was made known to
the regency in Mexico on the 3d of January, 1822,
and on the 5th the subject was discussed in all its
bearings. Valle moved that the decision should be
postponed until the receipt of the returns of the 67
ayuntamientos not yet heard from. Rivera, Calderon,
and Alvarado objected to any action. Gainza advocated
the acceptance of the aid and protection tendered
by Mexico.<a name='FA_III-29' id='FA_III-29' href='#FN_III-29' class='fnanchor'>[III-29]</a> The junta, disregarding all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
objections adduced, and the marked differences in the
opinions of the ayuntamientos, decreed on the same
day, January 5, 1822, that the whole of Central
America should be annexed to the empire of Mexico,
without other conditions than the fulfilment of the
plan of Iguala and the treaties of Córdoba.<a name='FA_III-30' id='FA_III-30' href='#FN_III-30' class='fnanchor'>[III-30]</a> In a
manifesto of that date, it assured the people that, after
obtaining the votes of all the authorities, corporations,
and prominent persons, and in view of the census of
population formed in September 1821, it was evident
that the vote for the union with Mexico had reached
a majority in Guatemala proper; and including the
votes of Nicaragua, Comayagua, Ciudad Real de
Chiapas, Quezaltenango, Sololá, and other towns
which had a few days previously declared themselves
for annexation, it would be found that almost the whole
population had expressed itself in favor of connection.<a name='FA_III-31' id='FA_III-31' href='#FN_III-31' class='fnanchor'>[III-31]</a>
No member failed to record his name in favor of the
loss of nationality, though some had, as before stated,
suggested that certain guarantees should be required
previous to the completion of the surrender.

GAINZA'S EDICT.
</p>

<p>
Gainza issued a manifesto full of generalities, declared
there was no further need of electing deputies
to congress, and assured the people of a liberal government,
and future peace and prosperity.<a name='FA_III-32' id='FA_III-32' href='#FN_III-32' class='fnanchor'>[III-32]</a> Erelong
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_55' name='Page_55' href='#Page_55'>55</a></span>
events came to show how delusive were the promises
thus held out by the incoming régime. It was preposterous
on the part of an unconstituted country, as
Mexico then was, with a government whose existence
was precarious, to undertake the task of affording protection
to the people of Central America—to a people
that had been brought under the yoke of the so-called
empire in such an unprecedented manner.
</p>

<p>
Forgetting, after a few days, the honeyed words of
his manifesto, Gainza,<a name='FA_III-33' id='FA_III-33' href='#FN_III-33' class='fnanchor'>[III-33]</a> on January 9th, issued a
stringent edict, countersigned by José María Celaya
as secretary, giving renewed force to his former edicts
of September 17th and December 1st, and forbidding,
under the penalties provided by the laws against
sedition, that any one should, either by tongue or pen,
censure or refute the action adopted as the will of the
majority. Conversations on the subject in the streets
or public places were prohibited, and citizens were
enjoined to report at once to the authorities any attempted
conspiracy against the new government which
might come to their knowledge. Constitutional alcaldes
and other local authorities were charged with
the execution of this decree.
</p>

<p>
Gainza and his junta thus gave way to the wishes
of the would-be oligarchs and the clergy, ignoring the
fact, formerly recognized by them, that to the representatives
of the people in congress exclusively belonged
the decision of the question on the future
status of the country.<a name='FA_III-34' id='FA_III-34' href='#FN_III-34' class='fnanchor'>[III-34]</a> The aristocrats and clericals

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_56' name='Page_56' href='#Page_56'>56</a></span>
representatives, and took advantage of them to carry
out their designs. The truth is, that the device resorted
to, of acting upon the opinions of ayuntamientos
which they well knew had no authority in the
premises, was illegal. And, indeed, could a population
of upwards of one million, scattered over 75,000
square miles of territory, have duly considered so vital
a matter as the abdication of their national autonomy
within the short period of thirty days? The whole
secret of the aristocratic success lay in the pressure
brought to bear on the country with a military force
sent by Iturbide to support his pretensions.<a name='FA_III-35' id='FA_III-35' href='#FN_III-35' class='fnanchor'>[III-35]</a> The
following facts appeared in the imperial gazette of
Mexico: The regency announced on the 12th of November
to the junta soberana that Chiapas, as well
as the towns of Guatemala, had signified a wish to
be received as a part of the Mexican empire, asking
for military aid to uphold its acts. The regency
added, that the military aid must then be quite near
Chiapas, under the orders issued beforehand by the
generalissimo, 5,000 men having already, under the
conde de la Cadena, crossed the Tehuantepec River.
The junta graciously assented to the so-called wishes
of the people of Chiapas and Guatemala, giving them
the rights of Mexican citizens.<a name='FA_III-36' id='FA_III-36' href='#FN_III-36' class='fnanchor'>[III-36]</a>

had to be recruited in Chiapas; and yet Filisola finally

TROUBLES IN SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
The junta provisional, after its action of January
5th, had no further reason for continuing, and so dissolved
itself on the 21st of February. Gainza, retaining
the offices of jefe superior político and captain-general,
called into life a diputacion provincial.<a name='FA_III-39' id='FA_III-39' href='#FN_III-39' class='fnanchor'>[III-39]</a> His
authority, however, was not regarded in Chiapas,
Honduras, Nicaragua, nor a great part of Salvador.

<p>
During Iturbide's occupation of his rickety throne,
Central America had deputies in the imperial congress,<a name='FA_III-40' id='FA_III-40' href='#FN_III-40' class='fnanchor'>[III-40]</a>
and the orders of the emperor's government
were generally obeyed. Nevertheless, plucky little
Salvador kept up the struggle against foreign domination.
Nearly a majority of its ayuntamientos, together
with the priest Delgado, the acting political
chief, had signified their wish to await the action of
congress; and on hearing of the surrender to Mexico
by Gainza and his junta, entered a protest and seceded,
resolving to remain independent till the representatives
of the whole people of Central America should
decide the question of nationality.<a name='FA_III-41' id='FA_III-41' href='#FN_III-41' class='fnanchor'>[III-41]</a>
</p>

<p>
But even here dissensions fostered from Guatemala
had their pernicious effects. Santa Ana and San
Miguel had voted for annexation to Mexico, and to
uphold this action, seceded from their own province,
which in that year led to a war between Salvador
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
and Guatemala. The government at San Salvador
gave the chief command of its forces to Manuel José
Arce, with orders to bring the people of Santa Ana
to reason, peaceably if he could, forcibly if he must.<a name='FA_III-42' id='FA_III-42' href='#FN_III-42' class='fnanchor'>[III-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
Arce marched on Santa Ana, when Padilla, commanding
a portion of the Sonsonate force which had
been stationed in that city, retreated within its own
territory. After compelling the town to revoke its
act of secession, Arce went in pursuit of Padilla, occupied
Ahuachapam, then an annex of Sonsonate,
and finally routed that officer in the hacienda El
Espinal.<a name='FA_III-43' id='FA_III-43' href='#FN_III-43' class='fnanchor'>[III-43]</a> This was the first act of a bloody war,

<p class="sidenote">DEFEAT OF ARZÚ.
</p>

<p>
Arce's invasion of territory occupied by Guatemala
afforded the latter a sufficient pretext, if any
were needed, to declare war against her high-spirited
and troublesome neighbor. Colonel Arzú was thereupon
despatched on the 19th of March, 1822, at the
head of a force, which in a few days had been increased
to 1,000 men, to bring Salvador under subjection.
Arzú's dilatory movements, however, defeated the
object of the expedition.<a name='FA_IV-1' id='FA_IV-1' href='#FN_IV-1' class='fnanchor'>[IV-1]</a> He lost two months and
more waiting for reënforcements and artillery, and by
indecision as to whether or not he should heed the
protestations of the Salvadorans.<a name='FA_IV-2' id='FA_IV-2' href='#FN_IV-2' class='fnanchor'>[IV-2]</a> The latter employed
the time thus gained in fortifying their city,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
though short of arms to equip a sufficient garrison.
Aroused at last by Gainza's positive commands, Arzú
continued his march,<a name='FA_IV-3' id='FA_IV-3' href='#FN_IV-3' class='fnanchor'>[IV-3]</a> and avoiding the fortifications
of San Salvador, entered the city on the 3d of June,
taking its defenders by surprise.<a name='FA_IV-4' id='FA_IV-4' href='#FN_IV-4' class='fnanchor'>[IV-4]</a> Having now every
advantage, Arzú might have made himself master of
the place had he not carelessly permitted his troops
to disband for purposes of plunder. The result was,
that the Salvadorans had time to rally, and a street
fight ensued, ending with the total discomfiture of
Arzú and his force, who with the loss of their arms
were driven from the city.<a name='FA_IV-5' id='FA_IV-5' href='#FN_IV-5' class='fnanchor'>[IV-5]</a> Had the victors made
the most of their success, they might have annihilated
the invading force; but they failed to conduct the pursuit
with any skill.<a name='FA_IV-6' id='FA_IV-6' href='#FN_IV-6' class='fnanchor'>[IV-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Arzú's defeat produced a deep impression in Guatemala,
where such a result had been unexpected, the
expedition having been fitted out with the utmost
care. Fears began to be entertained that the Salvadorans
might become aggressors and invade Guatemala.
The friends of Mexico were therefore much
pleased on hearing that the Mexican commander,
Filisola, had been ordered to supersede Gainza, who
was summoned to Mexico.<a name='FA_IV-7' id='FA_IV-7' href='#FN_IV-7' class='fnanchor'>[IV-7]</a> With about 600 men
Filisola arrived in Guatemala on the 12th of June,
1822, and ten days later took possession of the government.
He inaugurated a comparatively good state
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
of affairs; for though as a supporter of the Mexican
cause, and specially of the empire, he aimed at consolidation,
yet his policy was a conciliatory one.<a name='FA_IV-8' id='FA_IV-8' href='#FN_IV-8' class='fnanchor'>[IV-8]</a>
He endeavored to obtain the assent of Salvador to
union with Mexico without resorting to force. At
first his course presented a promising aspect, inasmuch
as the representatives of the former apparently made
little objection; and on the news of Iturbide's call to
the Mexican throne, among the many congratulations
received by Filisola were those of Salvador, delivered
by a special deputation. But the object, as it turned
out, was merely to gain time. The negotiations were
continued several months, hostilities having been suspended
by both belligerents, till early in September
it was agreed that further negotiations should be
carried on directly with the executive and congress
of Mexico.<a name='FA_IV-9' id='FA_IV-9' href='#FN_IV-9' class='fnanchor'>[IV-9]</a> This agreement was not carried out,
however, owing to new difficulties raised by San Salvador.
Filisola, who evidently would not assume the
responsibility of war, referred the whole matter to
Mexico for instructions. Iturbide, who had just dissolved
the Mexican congress for its opposition to his
plans,<a name='FA_IV-10' id='FA_IV-10' href='#FN_IV-10' class='fnanchor'>[IV-10]</a> felt no inclination to permit little San Salvador
to dictate the terms of union, and disallowing the
armistice concluded by Filisola, ordered him to begin
hostilities forthwith if unconditional submission were
refused.<a name='FA_IV-11' id='FA_IV-11' href='#FN_IV-11' class='fnanchor'>[IV-11]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
FILISOLA'S CAMPAIGN.
</p>

<p>
Leaving his second officer, Colonel Codallos, in
charge of the government at Guatemala, Filisola began
the military operations toward the end of November,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
taking possession of Santa Ana and marching<a name='FA_IV-12' id='FA_IV-12' href='#FN_IV-12' class='fnanchor'>[IV-12]</a>
upon the city of San Salvador, after having routed
several small hostile detachments which attempted to
check his progress. At the same time he published
the decree of the Mexican government of November
4th, making of Central America, or the former captain-generalcy
of Guatemala, three <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">comandancias generales</span>,
namely, those of Chiapas, Sacatepequez, and
Costa Rica, the capitals being respectively Ciudad
Real, Nueva Guatemala, and Leon in Nicaragua.<a name='FA_IV-13' id='FA_IV-13' href='#FN_IV-13' class='fnanchor'>[IV-13]</a>
The government of San Salvador was in a precarious
situation; although disposing of an army whose numerical
force and equipment were not inferior to Filisola's,
yet it had neither discipline nor experienced
officers. The few encounters which had already
taken place between the two forces had made it evident
that the Salvadorans could not cope with Filisola's
military skill. Under the circumstances, the
authorities of San Salvador resolved upon incorporation
with Mexico, and demanded that Filisola should
proceed no farther. They declined to inform him of
the terms under which they would submit to annexation,
though offering to lay them before the congress
in Mexico. They based this action on the ground
that if their purpose became known in Salvador a
revolution would certainly follow.<a name='FA_IV-14' id='FA_IV-14' href='#FN_IV-14' class='fnanchor'>[IV-14]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Mexican commander paid no heed to these
ambiguous statements, which he considered devices
to gain time, and continued his march.<a name='FA_IV-15' id='FA_IV-15' href='#FN_IV-15' class='fnanchor'>[IV-15]</a>

</p>

<p class="sidenote">
FALL OF ITURBIDE.
</p>

<p>
It was at this critical moment that the congress of
San Salvador, carried away by hatred to Guatemala
and Mexico, resolved upon a singular step. On the
2d of December, 1822, the act of incorporation with
Mexico was repealed, and the state was placed under
the protectorate of the Anglo-American states, as an
integral portion thereof. Solemn protests were made
in the name of that republic against Filisola's hostile
acts. A member of the congress, Juan Manuel Rodriguez,
was commissioned to make known the incorporation
to the government of the United States.<a name='FA_IV-16' id='FA_IV-16' href='#FN_IV-16' class='fnanchor'>[IV-16]</a>
For a short time it seems that hopes were entertained
of an armed protection on the part of the northern republic
in favor of the new acquisition; but soon the
folly of such expectations became apparent. Filisola
disregarded the protests,<a name='FA_IV-17' id='FA_IV-17' href='#FN_IV-17' class='fnanchor'>[IV-17]</a> and after several victorious
encounters, routed the Salvadorans under Arce at
Mejicanos,<a name='FA_IV-18' id='FA_IV-18' href='#FN_IV-18' class='fnanchor'>[IV-18]</a> and entered the city of San Salvador without
further opposition on the 9th of February, 1823.
Filisola fulfilled the promise he had made the preceding
day to the ayuntamiento, that he would respect
all rights, and not treat the town as a conquered country.
The only Salvadoran force remaining was compelled,
on the 21st of February, to surrender at Gualcince,
a town on the other side of the Lempa River.<a name='FA_IV-19' id='FA_IV-19' href='#FN_IV-19' class='fnanchor'>[IV-19]</a>
This was the end of the war.<a name='FA_IV-20' id='FA_IV-20' href='#FN_IV-20' class='fnanchor'>[IV-20]</a> Arce, who departed
for the United States, wrote Filisola from Belize a
letter full of firmness and dignity, meanwhile thanking
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_65' name='Page_65' href='#Page_65'>65</a></span>
him for his humane conduct. Delgado remained
at his hacienda. The local authorities swore allegiance
to the Mexican empire. Filisola now returned
to Guatemala,<a name='FA_IV-21' id='FA_IV-21' href='#FN_IV-21' class='fnanchor'>[IV-21]</a> where he arrived about the 6th or
7th of March. He had already received the news of
the movement in Mexico resulting in the overthrow
of Iturbide. It was this that hastened his return to
Guatemala, and induced him to adopt a course opposed
to his last instructions from Mexico. Granada, in
Nicaragua, had not been reduced to obedience. Governor
Gonzalez Saravia had asked for troops to accomplish
it, but Filisola declined to employ coercion;
and after informing him and Juan Fernandez Lindo,
governor of Honduras,<a name='FA_IV-22' id='FA_IV-22' href='#FN_IV-22' class='fnanchor'>[IV-22]</a> as well as other officials in
the provinces, of the state of affairs in Mexico, assured
them that he would take no important step without
first obtaining their assent. Indeed, after he convinced
himself that the imperial government had
fallen never to rise again, he arrived at the conclusion
that he had no right to keep annexed to Mexico the
Central American provinces; as the annexation had
been made solely, as claimed by Mexico and her supporters,
for the sake of securing stability to their
government, and the respect which would be afforded
it from a long distance by a great and wealthy country.
All this prestige had disappeared, owing to the
revolution at Casa Mata in Mexico,<a name='FA_IV-23' id='FA_IV-23' href='#FN_IV-23' class='fnanchor'>[IV-23]</a> the paper money,
and other arrangements made by Iturbide with reference
to these provinces.
</p>

<p>
Being asked to summon a congress of all the provinces
of Central America, he complied, issuing a decree
on the 29th of March, 1823, with the view of
carrying out the acta of September 15, 1821, which
had been annulled by the incorporation of the country
with Mexico. This was tantamount to a recognition
of the independence of Central America from Mexico.<a name='FA_IV-24' id='FA_IV-24' href='#FN_IV-24' class='fnanchor'>[IV-24]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_66' name='Page_66' href='#Page_66'>66</a></span>
His decree was hailed with joy by the party friendly
to absolute independence. The Mexican or imperialist
party was vanquished, and the people were ready
to take an active part in the coming elections. Peace
was not only temporarily restored in Guatemala and
Salvador, but in Nicaragua and Costa Rica party
struggles were brought to a close.

<p>
In Granada, Ordoñez had continued committing
many outrages.<a name='FA_IV-25' id='FA_IV-25' href='#FN_IV-25' class='fnanchor'>[IV-25]</a> He had successfully repulsed Saravia,
who had come against him from Leon. The latter
was in the act of preparing another expedition, when
Filisola's decree was promulgated, and he was summoned
to Guatemala. Nicaragua subsequently constituted
a junta gubernativa of its own.<a name='FA_IV-26' id='FA_IV-26' href='#FN_IV-26' class='fnanchor'>[IV-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
In Costa Rica, Saravia, with the aid of Bishop
Jerez, attempted to force the province into the union
with Mexico, and with that view endeavored to overthrow
the provincial government established at Cartago.
A conspiracy was planned there, and its authors,
seconded in Ciudad Vieja, openly espoused the cause
of Iturbide on the 29th of March. The men of the
liberal party fled to San José, and after strengthening
their ranks there and at Alajuela, attacked the
imperialists on the field of Las Lagunas, near Cartago,
and defeated them.<a name='FA_IV-27' id='FA_IV-27' href='#FN_IV-27' class='fnanchor'>[IV-27]</a> The town had to surrender,
and was occupied by the victorious independents, but
the seat of government remained in San José.<a name='FA_IV-28' id='FA_IV-28' href='#FN_IV-28' class='fnanchor'>[IV-28]</a>

<p>
Central America then, after a fifteen months' connection
with Mexico, was again in the same position
it had occupied at the time of separation from Spain.
No advantages had been derived from that union; but,
on the contrary, numerous heavy taxes had exhausted
the country, though the treasury was invariably
empty. The whole country was suffering from other
consequences of the internal wars, in the form of
abuses on the part of unscrupulous political parties
and military chiefs; none worse, however, than the
military sway imposed by Mexico.<a name='FA_IV-30' id='FA_IV-30' href='#FN_IV-30' class='fnanchor'>[IV-30]</a> There have not

having to organize a government imbued with the
prevailing liberal spirit; to improve the imperilled
finances; to establish relations with foreign powers;
and, what was of the highest importance, to bring
unity out of chaos. The first step toward the accomplishment
of these purposes was taken on the 1st
of July, 1823, with the adoption of the ordinance
which declared the provinces of the former captain-generalcy
of Guatemala to be free and independent
states, confederated into a nation under the name of
Provincias Unidas del Centro de América.<a name='FA_IV-36' id='FA_IV-36' href='#FN_IV-36' class='fnanchor'>[IV-36]</a> Inasmuch
as a considerable number of representatives
had not arrived on that date, the ordinance was subsequently
ratified on the 1st of October.<a name='FA_IV-37' id='FA_IV-37' href='#FN_IV-37' class='fnanchor'>[IV-37]</a> The new
confederation was recognized by Mexico only a little
more than a year after.<a name='FA_IV-38' id='FA_IV-38' href='#FN_IV-38' class='fnanchor'>[IV-38]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ORGANIZATION.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after independence was proclaimed, a division
of the powers of government into three branches
was resolved on; namely, the legislative, to be vested
in the asamblea; the executive, composed of three
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
members, to be elected by and to be subject to that
body; and the judicial, to be exercised by the existing
courts.<a name='FA_IV-39' id='FA_IV-39' href='#FN_IV-39' class='fnanchor'>[IV-39]</a> The executive, as then constituted, was to
be merely provisional, and until a fundamental code
should give it a permanent organization. The public
debt was recognized; the catholic religion was declared
to be that of the state; and freedom of the press
decreed.
</p>

<p>
From the moment that the choice of the executive
occupied the attention of the assembly a division of
parties became manifest. The friends of absolute independence
formed a large majority; those of the former
Mejicanistas were few in number. The larger
portion of the deputies was composed of the best men
of the country, whatever their party affiliations, and
their intentions were upright. Those of moderate
views from all sections formed themselves into one
party, and went by the name of moderados; their
opponents applying to them the epithets of servil and
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">aristócrata</span>.<a name='FA_IV-40' id='FA_IV-40' href='#FN_IV-40' class='fnanchor'>[IV-40]</a> The radicals formed another organization,
and were called fiebres and liberales, their enemies
also giving them the appellation of anarquistas.
</p>

<p>
The liberal party advocated the establishment of a
federal republic, and as a rule was guided by a liberal
patriotism, and a desire to see the abolishment of
unjust privileges and antiquated vices in the government.
Its opponents, in favor of a centralized government
and the continuation of the old fueros, struggled
against the restrictions that were being put to the
influence of Guatemala. Nevertheless, a liberal spirit
predominated for a time, and three well-known liberals
were chosen to constitute the executive authority,
namely, Manuel José Arce,<a name='FA_IV-41' id='FA_IV-41' href='#FN_IV-41' class='fnanchor'>[IV-41]</a> Doctor Pedro
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
Molina, and Juan Vicente Villacorta.<a name='FA_IV-42' id='FA_IV-42' href='#FN_IV-42' class='fnanchor'>[IV-42]</a> It must be
acknowledged that this government was not a strong
one, the only man of superior talent in it being Molina,
and he had little experience wherewith to found
a republic and manage its affairs at such a critical
period.
</p>

<p>
A constantly increasing coolness between the government
and Filisola became intensified when the
deputies from Costa Rica and Nicaragua refused to
occupy their seats in the assembly while a Mexican
army had virtual sway over the capital. Complaints
also came from various quarters, of abuses committed
by the Mexican soldiers,<a name='FA_IV-43' id='FA_IV-43' href='#FN_IV-43' class='fnanchor'>[IV-43]</a> and demands were made
for their departure. Some time elapsed in discussions
and negotiations, partly because of difficulty in raising
the needed funds. But finally, all obstacles being
removed, Filisola departed with his force on the 3d
of August, 1823, leaving behind him a good name,
which was little affected by charges preferred against
him at a later date.<a name='FA_IV-44' id='FA_IV-44' href='#FN_IV-44' class='fnanchor'>[IV-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
The liberals now were at greater liberty to carry
out their plans, which involved, among other things,
the disappearance of old practices, including titles and
compellations,<a name='FA_IV-45' id='FA_IV-45' href='#FN_IV-45' class='fnanchor'>[IV-45]</a> not even the hackneyed 'don' escaping
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'>71</a></span>
the general reformatory tendency.<a name='FA_IV-46' id='FA_IV-46' href='#FN_IV-46' class='fnanchor'>[IV-46]</a> A coat of arms
was likewise decreed, showing the national name in
golden letters,<a name='FA_IV-47' id='FA_IV-47' href='#FN_IV-47' class='fnanchor'>[IV-47]</a> as also a
flag, the latter consisting of
three horizontal stripes, the
middle one being white,
with the national coat of
arms about half-way from
the mast, and the other two
blue.

DECREES OF THE GOVERNMENT.
</p>

<p>
Among other decrees enacted
by the assembly in
1823, the following are
worthy of mention: One of
August 21st, to annul all
acts of the late imperial government affecting Central
America; one of August 26th, declaring the 15th
of September to be the national anniversary, and how
it was to be observed—this decree was reiterated
by the legislative assembly on the 15th of October,
1834; one of October 27th, directing the Central
American deputies—those of Chiapas excepted—to
withdraw from the Mexican congress; and one of
November 15th, to form a general census.<a name='FA_IV-48' id='FA_IV-48' href='#FN_IV-48' class='fnanchor'>[IV-48]</a>

ARIZA'S REVOLT.
</p>

<p>
Another measure adopted was that which authorized
the executive to dismiss without formality all
officials having their appointments from the Spanish
or Mexican governments. Little discretion was shown
in this, and discontent resulted, which was made manifest
in the opposition met with by every measure of
the government, even such as were generally recognized
to be of public utility. Financial and military
affairs were in the worst possible condition. To improve
the former was a difficult task, the expenses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'>72</a></span>
being greater than during the colonial period, and
several branches of revenue, which formerly yielded
considerable resources, having disappeared with the
old dependence.<a name='FA_IV-49' id='FA_IV-49' href='#FN_IV-49' class='fnanchor'>[IV-49]</a> As to the army, the greater part
of it had been disbanded, and only one battalion of
the regular force and a few bodies of militia formed
the entire defensive power of the republic. The government
was almost at the mercy of a handful of men,
and it was not long before they exhibited their lack
of discipline and loyalty. The soldiers had for some
time past shown dissatisfaction at the neglect of the
government to pay them their dues. Under the circumstances,
it was rather easy to prevail on them to
revolt, and it was done, the leader being Captain Rafael
Ariza y Torres.<a name='FA_IV-50' id='FA_IV-50' href='#FN_IV-50' class='fnanchor'>[IV-50]</a> The authorities, though aware
of his machinations, had taken no decisive measures
to defeat them,<a name='FA_IV-51' id='FA_IV-51' href='#FN_IV-51' class='fnanchor'>[IV-51]</a> other than commissioning Ignacio
Larrazábal to make an investigation. Ariza, fearing
that delay might cause the failure of his plan, in the
evening of the 13th of September assumed the title of
commander-in-chief of the forces; and the next morning<a name='FA_IV-52' id='FA_IV-52' href='#FN_IV-52' class='fnanchor'>[IV-52]</a>
volleys of musketry and other manifestations
apprised the alarmed inhabitants of the insurrection.
A scene of excitement ensued. The assembly hastily
met, and amidst the confusion a messenger came from
Ariza to assure the chamber of his loyal disposition
toward the government, and to add in explanation
that the position of commander had been forced upon
him by the troops. The messenger was peremptorily
ordered to retire without receiving any answer. A
number of enthusiastic citizens assailed a portion of
Ariza's men, only to be driven back to the university
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
building, where the assembly held its sittings. A
show of defence was made there,<a name='FA_IV-53' id='FA_IV-53' href='#FN_IV-53' class='fnanchor'>[IV-53]</a> to enable the assemblymen
to seek safety in flight. Few of their
number remained. Negotiations were then begun to
prevent the commission of outrages by the mutinous
soldiers,<a name='FA_IV-54' id='FA_IV-54' href='#FN_IV-54' class='fnanchor'>[IV-54]</a> and the government finally gave way, and
conferred on Ariza the title of commander-in-chief;
he thereupon took the official oath on that day. The
concession was made only to gain time, hopes being
entertained that the auxiliaries summoned from the
surrounding country and other states would soon arrive.
</p>

<p>
The rebellious captain had in the mean time begun
to realize his awkward position. Assuming a submissive
tone, he protested his readiness to obey the government;
whereupon he was commanded to leave the
city and retire to Antigua, where his force dispersed
before any coercive action on the part of the government
and its allies became necessary. Ariza himself
escaped by flight the punishment which his reckless
behavior deserved.<a name='FA_IV-55' id='FA_IV-55' href='#FN_IV-55' class='fnanchor'>[IV-55]</a>
</p>

<p>
But the difficulties were not yet over. The feeble
conduct of the government, and the humiliating concessions
it had made to the rebel, reflected so much
discredit that the labors of the moderado party for
the election of a new executive now gave promise of
fruitful results.<a name='FA_IV-56' id='FA_IV-56' href='#FN_IV-56' class='fnanchor'>[IV-56]</a> On the 4th of October congress reassembled,
and the same day Villacorta, Molina, and
Rivera tendered their resignations, which were accepted;
and in their stead, on the 4th of October,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
Manuel José Arce was again elected, together with
José del Valle and Tomás O'Horan,<a name='FA_IV-57' id='FA_IV-57' href='#FN_IV-57' class='fnanchor'>[IV-57]</a> and as substitutes
for the two first, then absent, José Santiago
Milla and Villacorta, the same person who had resigned.<a name='FA_IV-58' id='FA_IV-58' href='#FN_IV-58' class='fnanchor'>[IV-58]</a>
The new government found at once its attention
engrossed by the troublesome situation, which
had arisen from the coming of a Salvadoran force,
called to help against the revolting soldiers. Although
forbidden to approach the city, and ordered to return
home, it refused to comply,<a name='FA_IV-59' id='FA_IV-59' href='#FN_IV-59' class='fnanchor'>[IV-59]</a> and on the 12th of October
entered the city of Guatemala, all remonstrances
to the contrary having proved unavailing. The Salvadorans
occupied the capital three weeks, during
which rumors were rife of their plans to pillage the
place in retaliation of Guatemalan troops having occupied
San Salvador the previous year. Brawls and
fights between them and soldiers from other provinces
were of daily occurrence.
</p>

<p>
The regular garrison and all the inhabitants breathed
more freely when at last, on the 3d of November, the
unwelcome guests departed.<a name='FA_IV-60' id='FA_IV-60' href='#FN_IV-60' class='fnanchor'>[IV-60]</a> The same day the
auxiliary troops from Quezaltenango, who had been of
good use in keeping others somewhat in check, also
returned home.

<p class="sidenote">
A CONSTITUTION.
</p>

<p>
The labors of the assembly had been continued in
the mean time, and on the 17th of December, 1823,
were decreed and published the bases of the constitution
for the republic,<a name='FA_IV-61' id='FA_IV-61' href='#FN_IV-61' class='fnanchor'>[IV-61]</a> adopting a popular, representative,
federal form of government. Each one of the
five states, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica, which were to form the confederation
of Central America, was to have the same
division of powers, and with the same functions, in
its internal administration, as the general government
with respect to the whole republic.<a name='FA_IV-62' id='FA_IV-62' href='#FN_IV-62' class='fnanchor'>[IV-62]</a>
</p>

<p>
The labors of framing the constitution lasted a
year longer, and were terminated only on the 22d of
November, 1824, when the fundamental law of the
Central American republic was promulgated, strict
obedience thereto being solemnly sworn on the 15th
of April, 1825,<a name='FA_IV-63' id='FA_IV-63' href='#FN_IV-63' class='fnanchor'>[IV-63]</a> and ratified by the national congress
five months later, namely, on the 1st of September.
While discussing the constitution, both the liberal
and moderado parties used their best efforts for the
adoption of their respective principles. The former
triumphed, being especially strong in the provinces,
whereas its antagonists resided chiefly in the capital.
Although a number of good and able men were among
the members of the congress, their good purposes
were repeatedly balked by party spirit; and thus only
an imperfect result was obtained in the constitution
adopted November 22, 1824.<a name='FA_IV-64' id='FA_IV-64' href='#FN_IV-64' class='fnanchor'>[IV-64]</a> It was the first
effort to define the rules for the government of a country
which at that time was beginning the life of an
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
independent nation. The constitution of the United
States had been taken as a model; but it had not
been borne in mind that a difference existed between
the people of the northern and Central American
republics at the time when they respectively gained
their independence. However good the intentions of
the framers of the Central American constitution,
they fell short of their object; for in adopting certain
forms, altogether inappropriate, they also introduced
contradictory clauses. No provision was made for a
federal district to hold the national capital. Thus
Guatemala, where the federal authorities then and
afterward resided, became also the seat of the state
government, and in the course of time collisions were
unavoidable.<a name='FA_IV-65' id='FA_IV-65' href='#FN_IV-65' class='fnanchor'>[IV-65]</a> The constitution further defined the
rights of property and liberty of thought, as well as
freedom of the press, and placed the chief authority
of the republic in the hands of congress,<a name='FA_IV-66' id='FA_IV-66' href='#FN_IV-66' class='fnanchor'>[IV-66]</a> in addition
to the legislative power with which it was vested.
Laws were to be enacted by the two houses forming
the congress, one of which was the senate, whose
members were also elected by the people, two for
every state. This body acted as an executive council,
with a general supervision to see that the different
high officials and magistrates faithfully discharged
their duties. Its president was ex officio vice-president
of the republic.<a name='FA_IV-67' id='FA_IV-67' href='#FN_IV-67' class='fnanchor'>[IV-67]</a> A supreme court of justice
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_77' name='Page_77' href='#Page_77'>77</a></span>
was also created, the members being, like those of
congress and senate, chosen by popular vote.<a name='FA_IV-68' id='FA_IV-68' href='#FN_IV-68' class='fnanchor'>[IV-68]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SLAVERY ABOLISHED.
</p>

<p>
Among the most important laws enacted were
those of December 31, 1823, and April 17 and 24,
1824, which emancipated all slaves, and made free
slaves of other countries coming to Central America.<a name='FA_IV-69' id='FA_IV-69' href='#FN_IV-69' class='fnanchor'>[IV-69]</a>
The slave-trade was prohibited, under the penalty
of forfeiture of the rights of citizenship.<a name='FA_IV-70' id='FA_IV-70' href='#FN_IV-70' class='fnanchor'>[IV-70]</a> Of all
the nations of North America, to the Central American
republic belongs the honor of having first practically
abolished slavery.<a name='FA_IV-71' id='FA_IV-71' href='#FN_IV-71' class='fnanchor'>[IV-71]</a>
</p>

<p>
The new republic also took a deep interest in a project
for the union of all the American states.<a name='FA_IV-72' id='FA_IV-72' href='#FN_IV-72' class='fnanchor'>[IV-72]</a> The
project failed, because of its impracticability. The
particulars of this subject are given in treating of the
famous Panamá congress of American nations.
</p>

<p>
The exhausted condition of the treasury appearing
to be the chief impediment to all projected improvements,
the remedy was looked for in a foreign loan,
about $7,000,000 being borrowed on rather favorable
terms from a London firm.<a name='FA_IV-73' id='FA_IV-73' href='#FN_IV-73' class='fnanchor'>[IV-73]</a> The tobacco and customs
revenues were pledged toward its repayment.<a name='FA_IV-74' id='FA_IV-74' href='#FN_IV-74' class='fnanchor'>[IV-74]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_78' name='Page_78' href='#Page_78'>78</a></span>
It is understood that a portion of the money was
applied to strengthening the fortifications, and the
remainder was distributed among the states for their
local requirements.
</p>

<p>
The initiation and execution of the different measures
I have made mention of, and others of less magnitude,
were the work of the constituent assembly,
which closed its session on the 23d of January, 1825.
If all its resolutions were not wise ones, allowance
must be made for the many difficulties that were in
the way, and a full recognition given its members of
the good faith and assiduity with which they performed
their work.<a name='FA_IV-75' id='FA_IV-75' href='#FN_IV-75' class='fnanchor'>[IV-75]</a>

<p>
The first constitutional congress of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Estados
Federados de Centro América</span> was installed on the
6th of February, 1825, Mariano Galvez being chosen
president,<a name='FA_V-1' id='FA_V-1' href='#FN_V-1' class='fnanchor'>[V-1]</a> as well as the leader of the liberal party.
A number of the old delegates had been reëlected for
the new body,<a name='FA_V-2' id='FA_V-2' href='#FN_V-2' class='fnanchor'>[V-2]</a> whose principal duties were the election
of a president, and the ratification of the constitution.
The latter, as we have already seen, was on
the 1st of September; the former proved a more difficult
task, and was achieved amidst contradictions and
stormy discussions. The provisional executive power
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
elected in 1823 had not been harmonious. Arce and
Valle assumed their duties soon after their election,
and before many days had serious differences, which
ended in Arce's resignation of the presidency of the
triumvirate. Being replaced by José Manuel de la
Cerda, he departed for Salvador and Nicaragua, exerting
himself in the pacification of the latter. His
services in this direction won him much good-will,
and it was proposed to make him the first constitutional
president of the republic, a proposition that met
with popular favor. Meanwhile his opponent, Valle,
was also working.<a name='FA_V-3' id='FA_V-3' href='#FN_V-3' class='fnanchor'>[V-3]</a> Since May 1824 the congress had
been convoked. Both liberals and moderados had
untiringly worked for their respective candidates.
The latter seemed to have every prospect of victory;
of the 79 votes cast, 41 being for Valle, their candidate.<a name='FA_V-4' id='FA_V-4' href='#FN_V-4' class='fnanchor'>[V-4]</a>
As 42 votes were necessary for a choice under
the constitution, congress assumed the right of selecting
one of the two candidates. A compromise between
the contending parties was effected, Arce
pledging himself to remain neutral on certain questions
upon which the other party was much disturbed.<a name='FA_V-5' id='FA_V-5' href='#FN_V-5' class='fnanchor'>[V-5]</a>
The moderados then voted for Arce, and congress, on
the 21st of April, 1825, declared him to have been duly
elected by a majority of twenty-two votes against five
for Valle. The latter was recognized as the vice-president,
and having declined the position, Mariano
Beltranena was chosen in his place.<a name='FA_V-6' id='FA_V-6' href='#FN_V-6' class='fnanchor'>[V-6]</a> The justices of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
the supreme court were elected at the same time, and
on the 29th of April<a name='FA_V-7' id='FA_V-7' href='#FN_V-7' class='fnanchor'>[V-7]</a> took possession of their offices.

<p class="sidenote">
RECOGNITION BY THE UNITED STATES.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The recognition of the Central American republic
as an independent nation had engaged the attention
of the supreme authorities at the same time that the
internal organization was proceeding. The first treaty
concluded by the new republic was on the 15th of
March, 1825, with Colombia, Pedro Molina acting as
its plenipotentiary at Bogotá.<a name='FA_V-8' id='FA_V-8' href='#FN_V-8' class='fnanchor'>[V-8]</a> A few months later,
at Washington, on the 5th of December, 1825, a treaty
was entered into with the United States of America,
with which power there had been formal relations
since the beginning of the year.<a name='FA_V-9' id='FA_V-9' href='#FN_V-9' class='fnanchor'>[V-9]</a> Antonio José Cañas
represented Central America as her plenipotentiary.
The United States soon after accredited William
Miller as chargé d'affaires near the new republic.
Diplomatic relations with Great Britain and the
Netherlands were opened early in 1825. Spain continued
refusing to recognize the independence of Central
America, and the pope followed in her footsteps,
as he had done in regard to Mexico.<a name='FA_V-10' id='FA_V-10' href='#FN_V-10' class='fnanchor'>[V-10]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The republic being now fairly launched, had Arce
possessed the ability all might have gone well. But
he either overestimated his administrative powers, or
underrated the magnitude of his task; and after decreeing
some wise measures upon the military defences,
he began to sow dissatisfaction by his vacillating
policy. A member of the liberal party from the first
day that he took part in the political affairs of the
country, he now committed the serious error of
abandoning the ground upon which he might have
trod with safety. In his endeavors to please both
parties, he succeeded in offending the liberals without
securing the confidence of their opponents, who, though
willing enough to admit him to their ranks, declined
rendering implicit obedience. His former friends now
openly assailed him.<a name='FA_V-11' id='FA_V-11' href='#FN_V-11' class='fnanchor'>[V-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
A conflict sprang up, also, between the federal government
and the local authorities of Guatemala City,
because the latter refused to take part in celebrating
the anniversary of the installation of the first assembly
on the 24th of June, and force was at last brought to
bear upon them.<a name='FA_V-12' id='FA_V-12' href='#FN_V-12' class='fnanchor'>[V-12]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
ARCE, RAOUL, AND VALLE.
</p>

<p>
The ill-feeling against Arce became intensified when
the state government soon after decreed a transfer of
its seat to Guatemala, and for want of accommodations
in public buildings, took possession of the property of
private citizens without their consent. The owners
claimed protection from the federal congress, and
serious disturbances were averted only by a compromise.
During this episode the moderados or serviles
kept fanning the flame of discord between Arce and
the liberals, extolling his measures. When the first
congress closed its session, on the 25th of December,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'>83</a></span>
1825,<a name='FA_V-13' id='FA_V-13' href='#FN_V-13' class='fnanchor'>[V-13]</a> the political features of the country had notably
changed. But fortunately the danger to the republic
from the action of the serviles was avoided, because,
upon lots being cast on the 1st of October for the renewals
of members of congress,<a name='FA_V-14' id='FA_V-14' href='#FN_V-14' class='fnanchor'>[V-14]</a> the retiring members
happened to be chiefly of districts where the servile
party had majorities before, and were now replaced
by liberals, the preponderance of the latter being thus
increased. The second constitutional congress assembled
on the 1st of March, 1826. Among its members
was Valle, who, bent on revenge, erelong made
common cause with the liberals,<a name='FA_V-15' id='FA_V-15' href='#FN_V-15' class='fnanchor'>[V-15]</a> though he was not
allowed to exercise a predominant influence in their
counsels.
</p>

<p>
On the day congress opened, the president delivered
his message detailing the condition of the country,
but most of it had reference to the relations with
foreign powers.<a name='FA_V-16' id='FA_V-16' href='#FN_V-16' class='fnanchor'>[V-16]</a> The impending rupture was finally
hastened by the president's course toward Colonel
Nicolás Raoul, a French officer who had recently arrived
from Colombia, and had been made commander
of the artillery and a member of the council of war.<a name='FA_V-17' id='FA_V-17' href='#FN_V-17' class='fnanchor'>[V-17]</a>
Notwithstanding the considerations and favors conferred
on him by Arce, no sooner had he received his
appointment than he openly sided with the liberals
and gave utterances against the government. Therefore,
when Raoul was summoned by congress to aid
in the organization of the federal troops, the president,
to get rid of him, sent him to explore the northern
coasts.<a name='FA_V-18' id='FA_V-18' href='#FN_V-18' class='fnanchor'>[V-18]</a> Arce then undertook to increase the federal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'>84</a></span>
army to 4,000 men, under the pretext that such a
force was needed for the pacification of Nicaragua,
and the defence of the country against a Spanish invasion,
rumors of which were circulating. In order
to facilitate the operation, he proposed that the members
of congress should stir up public enthusiasm in
their respective states; but instead of acceding to his
recommendation, several persons known to be hostile
to the government, among them Raoul, were selected
by that body. All remonstrances to the contrary on
the part of Arce<a name='FA_V-19' id='FA_V-19' href='#FN_V-19' class='fnanchor'>[V-19]</a> had no other effect than to imbitter
the liberals against him. Charges were accordingly
brought forth, such as his neglecting to lay before
congress an account of expenditures during his administration,
and his having squandered a considerable
portion of the money raised by loan in London. The
outcry against his conduct was growing louder from
day to day.
</p>

<p>
This unsatisfactory state of affairs determined Arce
to dissolve congress. Still he was loath to use violent
means, and in fact, there was no need of it. One of
the clauses of the constitution allowed the admission
of substitutes for the deputies to congress in certain
cases, and both parties had taken advantage of it
without opposition. However, when the question of
calling the president to account arose, the serviles
protested against the presence of the liberal substitutes
which gave to that party the majority.<a name='FA_V-20' id='FA_V-20' href='#FN_V-20' class='fnanchor'>[V-20]</a> On
the 2d of June the deputies from Salvador, under instructions
from their government, which was friendly
to Arce, abandoned their seats, their example being
followed by those from Costa Rica and most of the
serviles, thus leaving the chamber without a quorum.<a name='FA_V-21' id='FA_V-21' href='#FN_V-21' class='fnanchor'>[V-21]</a>
The session was reopened, however, ten days later,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
upon the liberals pledging themselves not to introduce
any motion against the president or the serviles, and
thenceforth the discussions were confined to matters
of a general character till the 30th of June, when the
session was closed; but the deputies of Salvador and
Costa Rica had not resumed their seats.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
STATE AND NATION.
</p>

<p>
It was now evident that a collision was unavoidable.
The state government, controlled by the liberals, became
fearful that the serviles, in their endeavor to
support the president, might also attack the authorities
of Guatemala, and under the pretext of an invasion
threatening from Chiapas, secretly began to make
military preparations. Salvador and Costa Rica, on
the other hand, offered aid of troops to the federal
government. Both parties precipitated the crisis: the
liberals by their heedless attacks on the clergy,<a name='FA_V-22' id='FA_V-22' href='#FN_V-22' class='fnanchor'>[V-22]</a> and
specially by ridiculing its members; the serviles by
fanning, jointly with the clericals, ill feeling among
the low, ignorant classes, whom it was easy to persuade
that the liberal party aimed at the destruction
of their religion. This had now become a matter of
greater ease, owing to the irritation already existing,
caused by the forced loans and recruiting for the army
decreed by the state government. Strange though
it may appear, the serviles had no suspicion that the
federal authorities were aware of their intrigues. The
clash came in May 1826, when Raoul, without having
fulfilled his commission on the northern coast, tendered
his resignation, accompanied with a number of invectives
against the executive, which he subsequently
repeated in a second letter.<a name='FA_V-23' id='FA_V-23' href='#FN_V-23' class='fnanchor'>[V-23]</a> He was arrested on the
17th of July, and subjected to the action of a court-martial
for disrespect and insubordination. This raised
a storm of fury in the local legislature, where Raoul's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_86' name='Page_86' href='#Page_86'>86</a></span>
arrest was considered as an encroachment on the state's
authority. An order of arrest was issued against
Captain Espínola, the officer who had carried out the
commands of the federal executive, and the jefe, or
chief of the state, Juan Barrundia, was authorized to
raise a sufficient force to seize Espínola's person,<a name='FA_V-24' id='FA_V-24' href='#FN_V-24' class='fnanchor'>[V-24]</a> and
the pecuniary contingent of the state for federal expenses
was withheld.<a name='FA_V-25' id='FA_V-25' href='#FN_V-25' class='fnanchor'>[V-25]</a>
</p>

<p>
The troops despatched to arrest Espínola numbered
300 men, and were commanded by Cayetano de la
Cerda, who encountered his man near Acasaguastlan.
To avoid bloodshed, a capitulation was agreed upon
by both parties until they should obtain further orders
from their respective governments.<a name='FA_V-26' id='FA_V-26' href='#FN_V-26' class='fnanchor'>[V-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
When news of this agreement reached Guatemala,
a few days later, simultaneously rumors came to the
ears of Arce that a coup-de-main was contemplated
by Barrundia, with the evident intent of effecting his
removal. To anticipate the blow,<a name='FA_V-27' id='FA_V-27' href='#FN_V-27' class='fnanchor'>[V-27]</a> on the 5th of
September Arce secretly ordered the commander of
the federal forces to arrest Barrundia at an early hour
the following morning, and disarm the state troops,
using force if necessary.<a name='FA_V-28' id='FA_V-28' href='#FN_V-28' class='fnanchor'>[V-28]</a> This was done, the officer
meeting with no resistance.<a name='FA_V-29' id='FA_V-29' href='#FN_V-29' class='fnanchor'>[V-29]</a> The liberals had no
suspicion of Arce's resolve till after its execution.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_87' name='Page_87' href='#Page_87'>87</a></span>
The vice-jefe of the state, Cirilo Flores, then forthwith
assumed the government, and being tendered
the aid of federal troops to support his authority,
proudly rejected it.<a name='FA_V-30' id='FA_V-30' href='#FN_V-30' class='fnanchor'>[V-30]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ARREST OF BARRUNDIA.
</p>

<p>
On the following day the chiefs of the other states
were apprised of Barrundia's arrest, in a circular from
Arce defending his course, which he declared to have
been pursuant to duty under the constitution.<a name='FA_V-31' id='FA_V-31' href='#FN_V-31' class='fnanchor'>[V-31]</a> Such
was the position assumed by his friends and by the
serviles in general; while the radical liberals, taking a
different view, denounced him as a violator of the
constitution.<a name='FA_V-32' id='FA_V-32' href='#FN_V-32' class='fnanchor'>[V-32]</a> However, the energy thus displayed
by Arce was rather favorably looked upon, perhaps
from a feeling of relief arising from the supposition
that party bickerings had been brought to an end,
more than from any sympathy for Arce. The president
might now have strengthened his party, but did
not, and went on committing serious mistakes. Instead
of turning the imprisoned Barrundia over to the
state assembly, as prescribed by the constitution, to
be tried upon the several charges that had been ostentatiously
preferred against him, he allowed the legal
time for prosecution to elapse, and then released the
prisoner under bonds.<a name='FA_V-33' id='FA_V-33' href='#FN_V-33' class='fnanchor'>[V-33]</a>
</p>

<p>
The second constitutional congress was to meet on
the 1st of October, 1826, and the liberal party had,
since September, industriously worked to secure a
majority. But on the appointed day there was no
quorum, the members of the opposition having refused
to take their seats, evidently to prevent the
adoption of any measures against the president.<a name='FA_V-34' id='FA_V-34' href='#FN_V-34' class='fnanchor'>[V-34]</a> It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
was rather suspicious that the government at San Salvador,
always friendly to Arce, had forbidden its delegates
to occupy their seats in congress unless it were
to discuss the expediency of transferring the federal
authorities to some place distant from Guatemala.<a name='FA_V-35' id='FA_V-35' href='#FN_V-35' class='fnanchor'>[V-35]</a>
It soon became apparent that the president's aim was
to have his own assembly, for on the 10th of October
he convoked an extraordinary congress.<a name='FA_V-36' id='FA_V-36' href='#FN_V-36' class='fnanchor'>[V-36]</a> This was
open violation of the constitution, which vested in the
senate the authority for convoking, and moreover
limited representation to only one delegate for every
30,000 inhabitants. Much indignation was felt by
the members of congress, who had constituted themselves
into an organizing commission, but dispersed
on the same day that Arce's decree was published.<a name='FA_V-37' id='FA_V-37' href='#FN_V-37' class='fnanchor'>[V-37]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
MURDER OF FLORES.
</p>

<p>
Exciting events now followed in quick succession.
The vice-jefe Cirilo Flores and the state authorities
had retired on the 8th of October to Quezaltenango,
where he was murdered a few days afterward—on the
13th—by a mob of fanatical Indians.<a name='FA_V-38' id='FA_V-38' href='#FN_V-38' class='fnanchor'>[V-38]</a> The act was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_89' name='Page_89' href='#Page_89'>89</a></span>
attributed to Arce and his immediate friends, but
apparently without much reason,<a name='FA_V-39' id='FA_V-39' href='#FN_V-39' class='fnanchor'>[V-39]</a> though it must be
admitted that intrigues of the servile party and the
preaching of hostile priests aroused the fanaticism of
the populace to such a degree that the slightest cause
would bring about the commission of outrages. The
trouble did not end with Flores' death, for many members
of the assembly and representative council were
compelled to flee for their lives.
</p>

<p>
The state was now powerless, for even its military
forces disappeared before the federal troops. The
liberals in the state and republic saw their hopes
dashed, and many emigrated.<a name='FA_V-40' id='FA_V-40' href='#FN_V-40' class='fnanchor'>[V-40]</a> Arce held the executive
authority of both the federation and the state of
Guatemala; and acting upon the advice of Salvador,
he began reorganization, decreeing on the 31st of
October the election of a new executive and legislature
for Guatemala, from which the inhabitants entertained
hopes of a final restoration of peace throughout
the republic. But those hopes were frustrated by a
sudden change of policy on the part of the Salvador
government, which surprised everybody, all the more
from the fact that it had heretofore firmly supported
the president.

ARCE'S VICTORY AND DEFEAT.
</p>

<p>
Pedro Molina arrived at San Salvador from Panamá
when Arce had in his charge the affairs of Guatemala,
and had decreed the new elections for the state.
Being a political opponent of the president, Molina
refused to go to Guatemala to report the action of
the Panamá congress. It was not a difficult matter
for him to find congenial spirits for an intrigue against
the federal executive. An estrangement had occurred
between Arce and Delgado, who aspired to be bishop
of San Salvador,<a name='FA_V-41' id='FA_V-41' href='#FN_V-41' class='fnanchor'>[V-41]</a> and was a man of great political
power. Moreover, it so happened that the jefe of
Salvador, owing to ill health, had to turn over his
office to the vice-jefe, Mariano Prado, who was under
the influence of the discontented party. His first act
was to repeal Arce's decree of October 10th convoking
an extraordinary congress at Cojutepeque.<a name='FA_V-42' id='FA_V-42' href='#FN_V-42' class='fnanchor'>[V-42]</a> Then
simultaneously forces were levied in Salvador, ostensibly
to protect congress when assembled at Ahuachapan.
Internal difficulties in Honduras led the
federal government to interfere;<a name='FA_V-43' id='FA_V-43' href='#FN_V-43' class='fnanchor'>[V-43]</a> and thus, at the
end of 1826, there were a number of forces at work
to drive Arce from the presidential seat. This state
of affairs continued till February 1827, when rumors
of an invasion began to circulate in Guatemala. The
next month Salvadoran forces, under Trigueros, started
on their march toward the capital. All doubts about
the plans of the invading army having ceased, Arce
displayed unusual activity in his preparations to meet
the enemy. With the aid of the newly chosen jefe
of Guatemala, Aycinena, he increased the garrison to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
2,000 men, and leaving the executive authority in
charge of Vice-president Beltranena, took personal
command of the troops. He made an effort, however,
to avert an encounter, but without avail;<a name='FA_V-44' id='FA_V-44' href='#FN_V-44' class='fnanchor'>[V-44]</a> and
they fought, a few days later, at Guadalupe, a short
distance from Guatemala, the invaders being repulsed,
and the following day, March 23d, utterly routed at
Arrazola.<a name='FA_V-45' id='FA_V-45' href='#FN_V-45' class='fnanchor'>[V-45]</a> This victory caused great exultation in
Guatemala, and Arce's prestige grew rapidly. Money
and reënforcements were cheerfully placed at his
command, and he allowed himself to be carried away
by evil counsels to pursue an aggressive policy and
punish Salvador.<a name='FA_V-46' id='FA_V-46' href='#FN_V-46' class='fnanchor'>[V-46]</a>

CÁSCARAS IN SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
The federal army marched in April into the state
of Salvador, and reënforced from Sonsonate and Santa
Ana,<a name='FA_V-47' id='FA_V-47' href='#FN_V-47' class='fnanchor'>[V-47]</a> reached Nejapa without opposition, that place
being about twelve miles from the city of San Salvador.
After certain negotiations for peace, which had
no satisfactory result, Arce attacked the city on the
18th of May, at the head of 2,000 men, and was repulsed
with heavy loss. His slow movements had
given the Salvadorans time to act.<a name='FA_V-48' id='FA_V-48' href='#FN_V-48' class='fnanchor'>[V-48]</a> His retreat was
in good order to Santa Ana; but from this place, desertions
having greatly diminished the force, it degenerated
into flight, of which the pursuing Salvadorans
failed to take advantage. Arce reached Cuajiniquilapa
toward the end of May, with only 300 men.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
This early failure of a war from which were to flow
such great results brought odium on Arce; but by the
efforts of friends, confidence in him was restored, and
about 700 men were obtained to resume operations by
taking Santa Ana.<a name='FA_V-49' id='FA_V-49' href='#FN_V-49' class='fnanchor'>[V-49]</a> For several months no events
of importance occurred. The time was employed by
Arce in strengthening his force, with which he made
a fruitless attempt to intercept a Salvador division that
assailed Sonsonate. Overtures for peace were again
made by Salvador, but though not absolutely rejected,
no understanding was arrived at. They gave rise,
however, to a discussion as to whether the federal
president was, as he thought himself, authorized to
decide upon the question of peace or war without consulting
the state government of Guatemala.<a name='FA_V-50' id='FA_V-50' href='#FN_V-50' class='fnanchor'>[V-50]</a> Piqued
at the opposition he had met, which he supposed to
arise from want of confidence, Arce received with
pleasure a request from Vice-president Beltranena
to give up the army and return to Guatemala and
take charge of the government.<a name='FA_V-51' id='FA_V-51' href='#FN_V-51' class='fnanchor'>[V-51]</a> Brigadier Francisco
Cáscaras was thereupon made commander of the
army on the 12th of October, 1827. Soon after Arce's
return to Guatemala he took steps to restore peace,
and issued, on the 5th of December, a decree to convoke
a new congress,<a name='FA_V-52' id='FA_V-52' href='#FN_V-52' class='fnanchor'>[V-52]</a> and at the same time ordered a
suspension of hostilities. But his commissioner, Juan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
de Dios Mayorga, who was to notify the authorities
at San Salvador of his measures, was not allowed to
proceed to that city, the Salvadorans, now reënforced
with officers exiled from Colombia,<a name='FA_V-53' id='FA_V-53' href='#FN_V-53' class='fnanchor'>[V-53]</a> being more than
ever opposed to conciliation. Hostilities were resumed
and conducted with alternating success;<a name='FA_V-54' id='FA_V-54' href='#FN_V-54' class='fnanchor'>[V-54]</a> but
on the whole, disadvantageously for the federal force,
owing to Cáscaras' lack of strategy, and the temporizing
policy of the enemy; for the latter, whenever
pressed, would make overtures of peace, protesting a
willingness to terminate the war, though breaking
their promises as fast as they were made.<a name='FA_V-55' id='FA_V-55' href='#FN_V-55' class='fnanchor'>[V-55]</a> Cáscaras'
situation was daily becoming perilous, on account of
the numerous desertions of his troops. At last, on
the 17th of December, a bloody encounter took place
in the streets of Santa Ana, which terminated in a
capitulation, under which both forces were to leave
the place the next day. Cáscaras left it as stipulated,
but Colonel Merino with the Salvadorans remained.<a name='FA_V-56' id='FA_V-56' href='#FN_V-56' class='fnanchor'>[V-56]</a>
Cáscaras returned to Guatemala toward the end of
December, the Salvadorans having regained possession
of Santa Ana, and of all the other places formerly
occupied by the federal army.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after, with Aycinena's assistance, another
federal army was organized, but Arce took good care
to give positions in it only to trusted friends.<a name='FA_V-57' id='FA_V-57' href='#FN_V-57' class='fnanchor'>[V-57]</a> As
soon as the organization was nearly completed, detachments
were sent to check the enemy's raids in Chiquimula,
and then, under the command of a foreigner
named William Perks, the army marched against the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
Salvadoran headquarters at Ahuachapan. Once more
stratagem was resorted to by the wily Salvadorans,
who made proffers of peace, the farce ending as usual.<a name='FA_V-58' id='FA_V-58' href='#FN_V-58' class='fnanchor'>[V-58]</a>
In the mean time troubles broke out in the federal army,
and Perks, the commander, was deposed by the field-officers
and sent to Guatemala as a prisoner.<a name='FA_V-59' id='FA_V-59' href='#FN_V-59' class='fnanchor'>[V-59]</a> The
command then devolved upon Colonel Antonio José
Irisarri. Arce tried in vain to have Perks reinstalled,
and his efforts in that direction only served to increase
the ill feeling, which grew so strong that on the 14th
of February, 1828, he turned over the executive
office, though without a formal resignation, to Beltranena,<a name='FA_V-60' id='FA_V-60' href='#FN_V-60' class='fnanchor'>[V-60]</a>
who conferred the command of the federal
army on Brigadier Manuel Arzú. This officer marched
at once against the Salvadorans, refusing to listen to
any overtures for negotiations from their chief, Merino.
The armies met at Chalchuapa on the 1st of
March, and the federal troops obtained a victory, which
drove the foe back to San Salvador.<a name='FA_V-61' id='FA_V-61' href='#FN_V-61' class='fnanchor'>[V-61]</a> Arzú followed
and made an assault on that city, in which both sides
gave proofs of extraordinary bravery. The assault
failed; at the end of six hours' fighting the assailants
had to retreat behind their intrenchments.<a name='FA_V-62' id='FA_V-62' href='#FN_V-62' class='fnanchor'>[V-62]</a> From
this time San Salvador and San Miguel became the
theatres of war. A series of encounters, none of sufficient
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
importance to be lengthily described, followed,
with varying success for either side.<a name='FA_V-63' id='FA_V-63' href='#FN_V-63' class='fnanchor'>[V-63]</a> The Salvadorans
having besieged the remnants of the federal army
under Colonel Manuel Montúfar, at Mejicanos, after

The division of the federal army that occupied the

by General Morazan at Gualcho on the 6th of July,
being intercepted on its retreat toward the Lempa,
laid down its arms, under honorable terms, at San

<p>
The condition of federal affairs was now far from
encouraging. It may be that Arce, had he been
replaced, might have turned disaster; but his application
had met with a refusal, and he took no further
part in the political events of the republic.<a name='FA_V-66' id='FA_V-66' href='#FN_V-66' class='fnanchor'>[V-66]</a> After all
hostile forces had been either captured or expelled from
Salvador, Morazan made a triumphant entry into the
state capital on the 23d of October, 1828.<a name='FA_V-67' id='FA_V-67' href='#FN_V-67' class='fnanchor'>[V-67]</a> Shortly
before this a commission had come from Costa Rica
to mediate between Guatemala and Salvador, but the
latter demanded too much.<a name='FA_V-68' id='FA_V-68' href='#FN_V-68' class='fnanchor'>[V-68]</a> Morazan's presence in
San Salvador greatly strengthened the warlike party,
and the idea of invading Guatemala gained favor from
day to day, till it was finally carried out. After peace
overtures had been rejected by the federal authorities,
Morazan began his march toward Guatemala in
the latter end of November 1828.<a name='FA_V-69' id='FA_V-69' href='#FN_V-69' class='fnanchor'>[V-69]</a> The news struck
terror into the hearts of the now defenceless Guatemalans,
and no steps to meet the emergency could
be taken, owing to lack of order, official rivalries, and
party intrigues. It was, as a saving measure, finally
decided in the assembly to detach the state from the
federation, though it was never sanctioned or carried
out. To increase difficulties, a revolution broke out
in the department of La Antigua, placing it under
the protection of Morazan,<a name='FA_V-70' id='FA_V-70' href='#FN_V-70' class='fnanchor'>[V-70]</a> who, at the head of about
2,000 men, assuming the title of '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ejército aliado protector

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_97' name='Page_97' href='#Page_97'>97</a></span>
assailing it from the side of the Garita del Golfo,
on the 5th of February. He was repulsed after a
brisk fire.<a name='FA_V-71' id='FA_V-71' href='#FN_V-71' class='fnanchor'>[V-71]</a> This was followed on the 15th by a sally

SUCCESS OF MORAZAN.

<p>
In consequence of this reverse, Morazan raised the
siege of Guatemala, and concentrated his forces at
La Antigua. The success of Mixco was the last experienced
by the federal army; for with the same
neglect which had characterized its operations almost
throughout the whole campaign, no advantage was
taken of the victory, nor of several military errors of
Morazan.<a name='FA_V-73' id='FA_V-73' href='#FN_V-73' class='fnanchor'>[V-73]</a> A strong division under Pacheco sallied
out of Guatemala toward the towns of Zumpango

but Pacheco disseminated his force, and was beaten.<a name='FA_V-74' id='FA_V-74' href='#FN_V-74' class='fnanchor'>[V-74]</a>
Early in March Morazan's troops reoccupied Mixco,
and when attacked, shortly afterward,<a name='FA_V-75' id='FA_V-75' href='#FN_V-75' class='fnanchor'>[V-75]</a> by the federal

Through the mediation of General Verveer, minister
from the Netherlands, an attempt was made to
bring peace to the distracted country. Commissioners
representing the several belligerents assembled, on the
27th of March, at the house of Ballesteros, and discussed
the propositions laid before them, which were
rejected, and they then retired. Morazan, who was
anxious for a compromise, specially as he had good
reasons to apprehend the dissolution of his army by
the small-pox epidemic which had broken out, urged
Verveer to invite the commissioners to hold another
conference. It took place; and those of Salvador,
Honduras, and Nicaragua presented four propositions,
which were likewise rejected by the federal and Guatemalan
negotiators.<a name='FA_V-77' id='FA_V-77' href='#FN_V-77' class='fnanchor'>[V-77]</a> Morazan had felt certain that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_99' name='Page_99' href='#Page_99'>99</a></span>
those proposals would be accepted, and believed them
to be exceedingly generous in view of the fact that
the city could no longer hold out. However, hostilities
were resumed, and on the 9th of April the forces
under Morazan attacked the city, and a part of it was
taken and plundered.<a name='FA_V-78' id='FA_V-78' href='#FN_V-78' class='fnanchor'>[V-78]</a>

Aycinena applied on the 11th to Morazan, as
commander-in-chief of the allied army of Honduras
and Salvador, for a suspension of hostilities, in order
to negotiate a capitulation which he was disposed to
enter into. Morazan replied at once that he could

MORAZAN'S MEASURES.
</p>

<p class="p2">
A period of reaction, or restoration as it was properly
called, was now inaugurated. During several
years the servile party had held undisputed control of
public affairs in Guatemala, crushing out all opposition
to the best of its ability. Its policy had been
one of intolerance, and its downfall was hailed with
joy. Morazan seemed to have been chosen by providence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_101' name='Page_101' href='#Page_101'>101</a></span>
to inflict condign punishment on those who had
so cruelly exercised a usurped power. Surrounded
as he was by so many diverse elements, the severity of
the blows he dealt must not be all laid to his account.
The state assembly, which had been dissolved in
1826, having again met on the 21st of April, 1829,<a name='FA_V-86' id='FA_V-86' href='#FN_V-86' class='fnanchor'>[V-86]</a>
with its old president, Nicolás Espinosa, was practically
a tool in the hands of the victorious general, and enacted
several vigorous laws against the vanquished
party.<a name='FA_V-87' id='FA_V-87' href='#FN_V-87' class='fnanchor'>[V-87]</a> On the 4th of June the assembly passed an
act, which was sanctioned by the consejo representativo
on the 12th, and by Jefe Barrundia on the 13th,
declaring null all elections made pursuant to the unconstitutional
decree of the president of the republic
dated October 31, 1826, and the subsequent ones of
1827 and 1828. It furthermore stamped as revolutionists
and usurpers all persons who by virtue of
those decrees had obtained and held office of the
federation or the state of Guatemala, and as such
guilty of high treason, and amenable to the death penalty.<a name='FA_V-88' id='FA_V-88' href='#FN_V-88' class='fnanchor'>[V-88]</a>
On the same day was issued a so-called amnesty
law; but the number of exemptions from its
benefits made its name a piece of irony.<a name='FA_V-89' id='FA_V-89' href='#FN_V-89' class='fnanchor'>[V-89]</a> The position
of the prisoners taken in Guatemala at the time
of the capture of said city, and others, became a more
complicated one, in consequence of a decree passed by
the assembly of Salvador on the 9th of June, declaring
that it would not recognize in the assembly of
Guatemala any authority to grant, without the assent
of the other states, amnesty to the factious disturbers
of public order; and that the capitulation entered
into between Morazan and Aycinena having been annulled,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_102' name='Page_102' href='#Page_102'>102</a></span>
the captives were really prisoners of war of the
allied states.<a name='FA_V-90' id='FA_V-90' href='#FN_V-90' class='fnanchor'>[V-90]</a> A number of the prisoners were, however,
permitted to go into exile within fifteen days,
paying first the expenses of their support while in
prison, and one third of the value of their estates<a name='FA_V-91' id='FA_V-91' href='#FN_V-91' class='fnanchor'>[V-91]</a>
into the federal treasury, as indemnification for the
damages they had inflicted on the country. That
privilege was not granted to the president and vice-president
and their ministers, the former chief of Guatemala,
and others. In fact, it was a proscription of
all the principal men who had sided with the servile
party.<a name='FA_V-92' id='FA_V-92' href='#FN_V-92' class='fnanchor'>[V-92]</a> It was also decreed that all salaries paid
from October 1826 to April 1829 should be refunded.
Harsh measures were used to force a compliance.
</p>

<p>
The federal congress that was dismissed in October
1826 assembled on the 22d of June,<a name='FA_V-93' id='FA_V-93' href='#FN_V-93' class='fnanchor'>[V-93]</a> under the presidency
of Doroteo Vasconcelos, and on the 25th José
Francisco Barrundia<a name='FA_V-94' id='FA_V-94' href='#FN_V-94' class='fnanchor'>[V-94]</a> assumed the office of president
of the republic, he being the senior senator, and
having been specially called thereto by the congress,
though the real power in the country was Morazan.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
EXPULSION OF FRIARS.
</p>

<p>
The chief point of discussion in congress<a name='FA_V-95' id='FA_V-95' href='#FN_V-95' class='fnanchor'>[V-95]</a> was, what
to do with the prisoners. Some members favored
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_103' name='Page_103' href='#Page_103'>103</a></span>
their execution, and though others disapproved of
such a disposal of them, none had sufficient courage
to openly condemn such vindictiveness. The discussions
continued till July 9th, when a number of the
prisoners were sent under an escort to Sonsonate, to
be embarked at Acajutla and expatriated.<a name='FA_V-96' id='FA_V-96' href='#FN_V-96' class='fnanchor'>[V-96]</a> Two days
later a similar blow was struck at the church, evidently
because of the sympathy of its head men with
the servile party.<a name='FA_V-97' id='FA_V-97' href='#FN_V-97' class='fnanchor'>[V-97]</a> During the night between the
10th and 11th of July, an armed force, acting under
orders of Morazan, who issued them in accordance
with the views of the acting president and the jefe of
Guatemala, seized the archbishop and the friars of
several orders, and despatched them to the Atlantic
coast, where they were embarked for Habana. Several
of the friars are represented to have died on the
voyage.<a name='FA_V-98' id='FA_V-98' href='#FN_V-98' class='fnanchor'>[V-98]</a> Whether there was sufficient cause for so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
violent a proceeding is doubtful. However, the federal
congress thanked the executive for his zeal. The
sentence of expatriation against the archbishop was
not formally issued till about a year after.<a name='FA_V-99' id='FA_V-99' href='#FN_V-99' class='fnanchor'>[V-99]</a> On the
28th of July the assembly of Guatemala decreed the
suppression of all monastic establishments of men, excepting
only the Bethlehemite hospitallers, who were
allowed to remain as secular priests, and prohibited
in the nunneries vows and professions in the future.
All the temporalities of the suppressed convents were
declared confiscated to the state. The federal congress
approved this act on the 7th of September, declaring
that the nation would no longer receive or recognize
within its territory any religious orders.<a name='FA_V-100' id='FA_V-100' href='#FN_V-100' class='fnanchor'>[V-100]</a>
</p>

<p>
Peace being finally restored, the large army of
Morazan was gradually dissolved, and the leader became
a candidate for the presidency. The necessity
of an energetic man, such as Morazan was, at the
head of affairs, was quite apparent, for new difficulties
were threatening from different quarters. Costa Rica,
disapproving the course of Salvador, declared her secession
from the union, and it was only after much
persuasion that she retracted it. The federal government,
and that of the state of Guatemala, now in
charge of Pedro Molina,<a name='FA_V-101' id='FA_V-101' href='#FN_V-101' class='fnanchor'>[V-101]</a> clashed on several occasions,
and specially when, in 1830, the question of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
constituting Guatemala city as a federal district again
came upon the tapis. The state rejected the plan, as
on every previous occasion.<a name='FA_V-102' id='FA_V-102' href='#FN_V-102' class='fnanchor'>[V-102]</a> A project of Molina
to reform the confederation met with the same fate.
He favored the model of the Swiss republic at that
time, abolishing the expensive machinery of a federal
government, which was almost continually at variance
with the different states.<a name='FA_V-103' id='FA_V-103' href='#FN_V-103' class='fnanchor'>[V-103]</a> The failure of this scheme
brought with it the downfall of Molina, who was

SPANISH EFFORTS.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The plan of King Fernando VII. of Spain for the
reconquest of his former American dominions, and the
steps he was taking to accomplish it, naturally caused
a sensation in Central America, where that monarch
would be sure to find elements favorable to his views.
The so-called nobles, who had endeavored, after the
downfall of Iturbide and the separation from Mexico,
to establish in Central America an aristocratic republic,
such as that of Genoa or Venice, had been again
balked in their aims by the successes of Morazan. In
their disappointment they turned their eyes to Fernando,
and through special agents, as well as through
Archbishop Casaus, made known to the captain-general
of Cuba that the circumstances Central America
was then in were most propitious for the restoration
of the royal sway; for, as they asserted, all honest,
right-thinking men and women in the country yearned
for it, and the Indians were likewise anxious for the
change. Therefore, the only opposition thereto lay in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
the comparatively small number of aspirants to public
offices, who made revolution in order to control
the public funds for their own benefit. Such reports
were full of encouragement for the Spaniards who
were intriguing in behalf of Fernando's interests,
which were probably also their own.
</p>

<p>
Positive information was at last received from a
reliable source that Spain was preparing, in Habana,
an expedition to land at Omoa and march on Guatemala,
where it expected to find the requisite coöperation.<a name='FA_V-105' id='FA_V-105' href='#FN_V-105' class='fnanchor'>[V-105]</a>
This report coincided with the departure of
the Spanish expedition under Brigadier Barradas to
Tampico.<a name='FA_V-106' id='FA_V-106' href='#FN_V-106' class='fnanchor'>[V-106]</a> President Barrundia, on the 3d of September,
1829, issued a stirring address; and the congress,
in October and November, with the sanction of
the executive, passed an act forbidding Spaniards to
enter or land in Central American territory under any
pretext. The ports of the republic were closed to the
Spanish flag, and to the products and manufactures of
Spain, her colonies, and dependencies.
</p>

<p>
There were not a few Spaniards who, together with
the self-styled nobles of native birth, desired to see
the flag of the old country waving again over Central
America. That anxiously wished for day had become
almost the only subject of conversation in their circles,
of which the assembly of Guatemala took due warning.
In November it declared the sequestration of
all property belonging to Spaniards who dwelt in the
republic, coupled with the assurance that none should
be restored till Spain had formally recognized the
independence of Central America.<a name='FA_V-107' id='FA_V-107' href='#FN_V-107' class='fnanchor'>[V-107]</a>

<p>
It is difficult for us to realize how long it takes and
how hard it is for progressive man to throw away the
fetters, temporal and spiritual, which in times past he
stupidly forged for himself. Intellectual light breaking
in on our old savagism finally tells us that the
hurtful manifestations of nature are not the chastisements
of offended deity; and then we wonder how
we could have been so stupid so long, with our pope-worship
and king-worship, and our servility to their
satellites. Then when we first gain our liberty we
know not what to do with it. We feel lost without
the harness, the reins, the whip and spur. The people
of Central America, high or low, knew little at
this juncture of self-government. In times past they
had observed that rulership consisted largely of personal
wranglings for place, from king and pope down
to the lowest aspirant; of wars, political and ecclesiastical,
brother against brother, priests and people
butchering and burning as if the great object of religion
and civilization was to preserve upon this earth
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_109' name='Page_109' href='#Page_109'>109</a></span>
as long as possible the hell which we all hope in one
way or another to escape hereafter.
</p>

<p>
Note further in regard to Central America the
strange union of widely distinct classes in their efforts
to sacrifice the country for self. Though from somewhat
different motives, we see join hands the highest
and the lowest, a self-styled aristocracy and the ignorant
rabble, aided by the priests who would not see
their power slip from them in the general overturnings,
all spending their energies and blood in the
direction of utter destruction for themselves, their
families, and their country. Fortunately there were
others at hand whose ideas of self-government were
different; who earnestly desired that this new plant
of liberty—a boon which had so unexpectedly dropped
down to them from heaven—should have in their
midst a healthy growth, in spite of ignorance, ambition,
or superstition.

TROUBLES IN HONDURAS.
</p>

<p>
The legislative assembly of Honduras, pursuant to
the proscriptive law enacted by the federal congress
in August 1829, issued a decree of expulsion, and the
government of the state transmitted to Guatemala a
list of those who had come within its provisions.<a name='FA_VI-1' id='FA_VI-1' href='#FN_VI-1' class='fnanchor'>[VI-1]</a>
Some exiles from Honduras and other states of Central
America went to Belize to carry on their plots
from that quarter, and soon caused a sedition in the
department of Olancho. The vice-jefe, Vijil, used
his best endeavors to bring the seditious to terms
peaceably, but failed.<a name='FA_VI-2' id='FA_VI-2' href='#FN_VI-2' class='fnanchor'>[VI-2]</a> It became necessary then to
resort to force, and Lieutenant-colonel Terrelonge was
authorized to move his troops from Trujillo against
Olancho. The state of Guatemala was also requested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
to send its force stationed in Chiquimula to Gracias,
for the purpose of aiding in the preservation of order.
The assembly of Guatemala, on the 24th of November,
1829, directed that 500 men, subject to the orders
of the chief of the state, should repair at once to
Honduras and quell the insurrection. The wording
of the decree caused a disagreement between the
president of the republic and Jefe Molina. The latter
insisted that the 500 men to be sent to Honduras
should be under his orders. President Barrundia
could not accede to it, because the command of a military
force operating out of the state belonged by law
to the federal government,<a name='FA_VI-3' id='FA_VI-3' href='#FN_VI-3' class='fnanchor'>[VI-3]</a> and through his minister
of war, Nicolás Espinosa, applied to the Guatemalan
legislature for a change in the decree. Espinosa's
communication caused much sensation, and the assembly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
repealed the act of November 24th, and in its
stead provided that the money needed to muster in
and equip 500 men should be furnished the general
government out of the state treasury.
</p>

<p>
Morazan, jefe of Honduras, and general-in-chief of
the Central American forces, had marched with a division
upon the departments of Olancho and Opoteca,
and to him were despatched the troops newly raised in
Guatemala. Colonel Vicente Dominguez was one of
the chief promoters of the revolution of Honduras.<a name='FA_VI-4' id='FA_VI-4' href='#FN_VI-4' class='fnanchor'>[VI-4]</a>
Morazan's military reputation made easy his road to
victory. He encountered no great difficulties. The
year 1830 was inaugurated with new triumphs. The
Olancho rebels surrendered to him at Las Vueltas del
Ocote, and on the 21st of January solemnly bound
themselves to recognize and obey the government.<a name='FA_VI-5' id='FA_VI-5' href='#FN_VI-5' class='fnanchor'>[VI-5]</a>
Morazan next, on the 19th of February, routed the
insurrectionists of Opoteca.<a name='FA_VI-6' id='FA_VI-6' href='#FN_VI-6' class='fnanchor'>[VI-6]</a> Morazan, after pacifying
Honduras, intended marching into Nicaragua, if political
measures should prove insufficient to establish
regularity there. He first despatched Dionisio Herrera
to the seat of Nicaraguan differences, who fulfilled
his trust with zeal, and Morazan had no need of
going to the state. Herrera had been chosen jefe, and
was duly inducted in his office on the 12th of May.

REVOLT AND ELECTION.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The time for renewing the supreme federal authority
having arrived, elections were held throughout the
republic. Congress opened its session with due solemnity
on the 27th of March, 1830. The supreme
court of justice was likewise installed.<a name='FA_VI-7' id='FA_VI-7' href='#FN_VI-7' class='fnanchor'>[VI-7]</a> The election

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
Morazan, José Francisco Barrundia, José del Valle,

</p>

<p>
The votes were counted in June. Morazan had
the largest number; but in order to ascertain if the
election had been legal, it was necessary first to declare
if the basis was to be the number of votes which
the citizens of the republic had the right to poll, or
that of the votes actually given and counted. If the
former, there had been no popular election, and congress
had to decide the point between Morazan and Valle;
in the latter case, Morazan had been popularly elected.<a name='FA_VI-9' id='FA_VI-9' href='#FN_VI-9' class='fnanchor'>[VI-9]</a>

MORAZAN PRESIDENT.
</p>

<p>
The congress consisted for the most part of friends
of Morazan, and he was declared president. He made
a triumphal entry into Guatemala on the 14th of September,
and should have been inaugurated on the 15th;
but it was decided that Barrundia should turn over
to him the executive office on the 16th, in the midst
of the festivities of national independence. This was
done by Barrundia with that republican simplicity
which had ever characterized the man. All the states
sent their congratulations to Morazan, and to Barrundia
for the good judgment and success of his administration.<a name='FA_VI-10' id='FA_VI-10' href='#FN_VI-10' class='fnanchor'>[VI-10]</a>
Mariano Prado, the distinguished
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
citizen of Salvador, who did such good service to the
liberal cause as vice-jefe of that state during the campaign
that ended in April 1829, was elected vice-president.
</p>

<p>
One of Barrundia's measures that did him honor
was his saving the island of Roatan to Central
America. The British had driven away the few inhabitants
and small garrison and taken possession.<a name='FA_VI-11' id='FA_VI-11' href='#FN_VI-11' class='fnanchor'>[VI-11]</a>
Barrundia made energetic though courteous remonstrances,
and the island was restored after Morazan
had become president.
</p>

<p>
The country now required peace. Morazan exerted
himself to foster education and national industry.
Agriculture and trade began to revive; but it was
not to be continued long, for the demon of political
strife was let loose again. The servile party, though
defeated, had not remained inactive. In 1831 it prepared
a plot for the destruction of the liberals, which
had ramifications everywhere. Arce was to invade
the republic from Mexico through Soconusco. Dominguez
was to occupy Honduras with elements gathered
for the purpose at Belize. Meantime, Ramon
Guzman seized the fort at Omoa with 200 negroes.<a name='FA_VI-12' id='FA_VI-12' href='#FN_VI-12' class='fnanchor'>[VI-12]</a>
Arce effected his invasion with about 100 men, exiled
and discontented Central Americans,<a name='FA_VI-13' id='FA_VI-13' href='#FN_VI-13' class='fnanchor'>[VI-13]</a> and was defeated
at Escuintla de Soconusco, on the 24th of
February, 1832, by the forces under General Raoul.
He succeeded in escaping with a few men into Mexico
again.<a name='FA_VI-14' id='FA_VI-14' href='#FN_VI-14' class='fnanchor'>[VI-14]</a> Guzman, being hard pressed at Omoa by the
government troops under Colonel Terrelonge, hoisted
the Spanish flag over the fort, and despatched, on the
10th of August, the schooner <i>Ejecutivo</i>, whose name
had been now changed to <i>General Dominguez</i>, to ask
assistance from the captain-general of Cuba, offering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_114' name='Page_114' href='#Page_114'>114</a></span>
himself and those with him as subjects of the Spanish
king. But the vessel was captured on her return
with supplies, and the rebel garrison surrendered on
the 12th of September, after a siege of five months.<a name='FA_VI-15' id='FA_VI-15' href='#FN_VI-15' class='fnanchor'>[VI-15]</a>
Almost at the same time that Omoa was seized by
the rebels, the port of Trujillo was occupied by Vicente
Dominguez, who had in his company Pedro Gonzalez.<a name='FA_VI-16' id='FA_VI-16' href='#FN_VI-16' class='fnanchor'>[VI-16]</a>
The Central Americans had two armed
schooners at Izabal, besides two national vessels
under Terrelonge, and an armed schooner at Belize.
Duplessis, a Frenchman, commanding the national
vessel <i>Fénix</i>, was captured by Dominguez, taken to
Omoa, and shot in the plaza.<a name='FA_VI-17' id='FA_VI-17' href='#FN_VI-17' class='fnanchor'>[VI-17]</a>
</p>

<p>
Dominguez' vanguard reached Yoro on the 7th of
March, 1832, and was defeated at Tercales on the 9th,
and again at Olanchito. He fled to Trujillo, leaving
behind 200 muskets, other arms, some money, and
other things.<a name='FA_VI-18' id='FA_VI-18' href='#FN_VI-18' class='fnanchor'>[VI-18]</a> He then transferred himself to Omoa,
and with 600 men, on the 26th of March, attacked
the government troops at Jaitique, being defeated.
He was again routed at Opoteca, pursued in all
directions, captured, and taken to Comayagua, where
he was put to death on the 14th of September.<a name='FA_VI-19' id='FA_VI-19' href='#FN_VI-19' class='fnanchor'>[VI-19]</a> The
rebel plot thus defeated was a formidable one. Archbishop
Casaus from Habana moved his clergy. Bishop
Fray Luis García of Chiapas favored Ex-president
Arce, whose friends confidently asserted that he also
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'>115</a></span>
had the support of the Mexican government.<a name='FA_VI-20' id='FA_VI-20' href='#FN_VI-20' class='fnanchor'>[VI-20]</a> Arce's
plans were also in combination with the jefe of Salvador,
José María Cornejo.<a name='FA_VI-21' id='FA_VI-21' href='#FN_VI-21' class='fnanchor'>[VI-21]</a> The fallen party would
not admit that they had been vanquished, that their
principles were antiquated and repugnant to the people;
they still believed that a reaction was not only possible,
but right and natural.

HONDURAS AND SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
Cornejo's intrigues led to a disturbance of the peace
in Salvador. The state assembly had been installed
in February 1831, and the tendencies of its members
elect, together with Cornejo's workings, had awakened
mistrust among the liberals of Guatemala. The assembly
of the latter state directed the executive, in
congratulating the Salvador assembly upon its installation,
to remind it of the necessity of harmony and
of upholding liberal principles.<a name='FA_VI-22' id='FA_VI-22' href='#FN_VI-22' class='fnanchor'>[VI-22]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the news of the invasion of Honduras, already
described, reaching Guatemala, Morazan decided to
establish his headquarters in San Salvador as a more
convenient centre for future operations. His relations
with the authorities of Salvador were anything but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_116' name='Page_116' href='#Page_116'>116</a></span>
harmonious; neither could they be harmonious under
the circumstances. Mariano Galvez, jefe of Guatemala,<a name='FA_VI-23' id='FA_VI-23' href='#FN_VI-23' class='fnanchor'>[VI-23]</a>
desiring to avoid conflicts, despatched Colonel
Nicolás Espinosa with letters to Cornejo, advising
him that his agent was instructed to use his best
offices to settle the differences between him and Morazan.
Espinosa, when near Atiquizaya, heard that
orders for his arrest had been issued, and therefore
went back. Galvez became justly indignant at the
conduct of Cornejo's agents.

<p>
The president of the republic started from Guatemala
on the 29th of December, 1831, accompanied by
his ministers, and journeyed toward San Salvador
without any military force other than his body-guard;
consequently Cornejo had no cause to apprehend any
sudden blow at his authority.<a name='FA_VI-24' id='FA_VI-24' href='#FN_VI-24' class='fnanchor'>[VI-24]</a> Nevertheless, on the
6th of January, 1832, Cornejo broke out in open rebellion,
commanding the national executive, then at
Santa Ana, to quit the state forthwith or he would
be driven away. Morazan, having no means of resistance,
obeyed. This insult to the republic was followed
next day, January 7, 1832, by an act declaring
the suspension of the federal compact and the secession
of the state of Salvador. Congress then empowered
the executive to repel invasions. The jefe
of Guatemala admitted the obligation of his state to
aid the general government with all its means.<a name='FA_VI-25' id='FA_VI-25' href='#FN_VI-25' class='fnanchor'>[VI-25]</a> The
assembly of Nicaragua, backed by the jefe Dionisio
Herrera, who was a stanch friend and supporter of
Morazan, passed an act disallowing the legitimacy of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_117' name='Page_117' href='#Page_117'>117</a></span>
the Salvador authorities and their acts, and providing
means to support the federal government.<a name='FA_VI-26' id='FA_VI-26' href='#FN_VI-26' class='fnanchor'>[VI-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica, through her minister of state, Joaquin
Bernardo Calvo, in a note from San José of March 3,
1832, to the government of Guatemala, signified her
readiness to support the laws, and with that end to
place at the disposal of the federal executive all the
aid in her power. A Guatemalan force was stationed
on the frontier of Salvador, first under Colonel Cárlos
Salazar, and afterward under Colonel Juan Prem, a
distinguished officer of the campaign of 1829. Even
now Galvez hoped to avert war, sending commissioners
to confer with Cornejo at Ahuachapan. The
latter received them, and appointed his own to continue
the conferences; but they were suddenly brought
to an end without results.<a name='FA_VI-27' id='FA_VI-27' href='#FN_VI-27' class='fnanchor'>[VI-27]</a> Further efforts on behalf
of peace were useless; the contest had to be decided

</p>

<p>
Morazan with a force of Salvador and Honduras
men marched from the river Lempa to Portillo. Cornejo
had 600 men in Jocoro of the department of San
Miguel. The latter were signally defeated on the
14th of March, losing 500 men in killed, wounded,
and prisoners.<a name='FA_VI-29' id='FA_VI-29' href='#FN_VI-29' class='fnanchor'>[VI-29]</a> This was soon followed by <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">pronunciamientos</span>
in several departments against Cornejo and
in favor of Morazan. The latter lost no time in
marching upon San Salvador, which he took by
assault on the 28th of March, notwithstanding the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>

assailing force being made up of Nicaraguans and
Hondurans.<a name='FA_VI-30' id='FA_VI-30' href='#FN_VI-30' class='fnanchor'>[VI-30]</a> The state authorities were deposed,
sent to Guatemala under a guard, and subsequently
tried by a special court created ex post facto, with the
name of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">jurado nacional</span>.<a name='FA_VI-31' id='FA_VI-31' href='#FN_VI-31' class='fnanchor'>[VI-31]</a> Morazan then assumed
control of Salvador until constitutional authorities
should be reorganized.<a name='FA_VI-32' id='FA_VI-32' href='#FN_VI-32' class='fnanchor'>[VI-32]</a> This step, illegal as it was,
gave dissatisfaction, not in Salvador alone, but in the
other states, which subsequently seceded from the
union; and though later retractions took place, it
may be said that the confederation was dissolved at
this period.<a name='FA_VI-33' id='FA_VI-33' href='#FN_VI-33' class='fnanchor'>[VI-33]</a>
</p>

<p>
Meantime, the federal congress had continued its
sessions, striving to promote the welfare of the country
by a liberal policy. Among the acts adopted at
this time, and deserving special mention, was that
of May 2, 1832, abolishing the exclusiveness of the
Roman religion, and recognizing freedom of conscience
and of worship.<a name='FA_VI-34' id='FA_VI-34' href='#FN_VI-34' class='fnanchor'>[VI-34]</a> This law, though practically of
little effect, inasmuch as there were but few foreigners
in the country, showed that a spirit of toleration was
gaining ground. Another important measure was the
adoption of Livingston's Louisiana code, and trial by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
jury. This form of trial was not understood by the
people, and fortunately fell into disuse.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ELEMENTS OF DISUNION.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the acts of disunion passed by the
several states, there was no serious disturbance during
the remainder of 1832 or in 1833. In the middle of
the latter year<a name='FA_VI-35' id='FA_VI-35' href='#FN_VI-35' class='fnanchor'>[VI-35]</a> congress adjourned, and there were
fair prospects of peace. Indeed, the liberals had been
made to see the folly of disunion. The states, relinquishing
their antagonisms, quietly returned to the
confederacy. The federal government, on the 20th of
April, 1833, convoked a new congress to adjust differences.
But now a new element of discord appeared.
This was the jealousy felt by the smaller states toward
Guatemala, which being larger in extent and population,
naturally had a corresponding influence in the
national congress.<a name='FA_VI-36' id='FA_VI-36' href='#FN_VI-36' class='fnanchor'>[VI-36]</a> These states demanded an equal
voice in that body, and insisted that this right should
be recognized before proceeding to the elections.<a name='FA_VI-37' id='FA_VI-37' href='#FN_VI-37' class='fnanchor'>[VI-37]</a>
Guatemala, heeding the anxiety of the liberal leaders,
assented to the demand. Some of the states proceeded
with their elections, but it soon became obvious
that the plan of compromise could not be satisfactory
or permanent, and it was dropped. The proposed
congress accordingly did not meet.<a name='FA_VI-38' id='FA_VI-38' href='#FN_VI-38' class='fnanchor'>[VI-38]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rumors were current for some time in 1833 of an
intended invasion of Salvador by Arce, by sea from
Acapulco,<a name='FA_VI-39' id='FA_VI-39' href='#FN_VI-39' class='fnanchor'>[VI-39]</a> but they proved to be unfounded. The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_120' name='Page_120' href='#Page_120'>120</a></span>
federal government transferred its seat on the 5th of
February, 1834,<a name='FA_VI-40' id='FA_VI-40' href='#FN_VI-40' class='fnanchor'>[VI-40]</a> first to Sonsonate, and later to San
Salvador, which for the time being quieted the jealous
feeling of the several states against Guatemala. But
after a few weeks the dissensions between the federal
and state governments, of so frequent occurrence when
the former was in Guatemala, were renewed in San
Salvador. On the 23d of June, 1834, a fight took
place between troops of the two parties, and the affair
ended in another overthrow of the local authorities,<a name='FA_VI-41' id='FA_VI-41' href='#FN_VI-41' class='fnanchor'>[VI-41]</a>
who were proscribed under ex post facto laws.<a name='FA_VI-42' id='FA_VI-42' href='#FN_VI-42' class='fnanchor'>[VI-42]</a> The
state government went first into the hands of General
Salazar, who called himself jefe provisorio, and afterward
into those of the vice-president of the republic.
Neither had any legal authority in the premises. This
state of affairs caused dissatisfaction in Salvador.
Political disturbances were also experienced in other
states. The flame of discord was fanned everywhere
by the oligarchs, who found their task made easier by
the extreme religious liberalism of the ruling party.
Their influence was felt when, on the 7th of February,
1835, after San Salvador, together with a few surrounding
towns, was constituted a federal district,<a name='FA_VI-43' id='FA_VI-43' href='#FN_VI-43' class='fnanchor'>[VI-43]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_121' name='Page_121' href='#Page_121'>121</a></span>
a new constitution, based on the former one of 1824,
was generally rejected.<a name='FA_VI-44' id='FA_VI-44' href='#FN_VI-44' class='fnanchor'>[VI-44]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
ELECTION AND DEATH OF VALLE.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Elections for supreme authorities of the republic
were decreed on the 2d of June, 1838. The end of
Morazan's term was approaching, and his popularity
was to be again put to the test. There was really
but one man that could compete with him, José del
Valle, who was leading a retired life devoted to scientific
and political studies; but his reputation was a
national one, eminently Central American, and a
large portion of the people summoned him to rulership.
He was elected, but died before the certificates
of election were opened.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The death of Valle occurred on the 2d of March,
1834. The highest honors were paid to his memory.<a name='FA_VI-45' id='FA_VI-45' href='#FN_VI-45' class='fnanchor'>[VI-45]</a>
This untoward event necessitated another election to
carry out the decree of June 1833, and José Francisco
Barrundia having declined to be a candidate,
Morazan encountered no opposition and was reëlected.<a name='FA_VI-46' id='FA_VI-46' href='#FN_VI-46' class='fnanchor'>[VI-46]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_122' name='Page_122' href='#Page_122'>122</a></span>
For the office of vice-president, no one having obtained
the constitutional number of votes, congress,
on the 2d of June, 1834, chose from among candidates
having forty votes and upward José Gregorio Salazar,
to be inducted in office on the 16th. Mariano Prado,
the former vice-president, had been as such at the
head of the federal executive authority in 1831; but
he was chosen jefe of the state of Salvador, and took
charge of that office on the 25th of July following.
The vice-presidency and the office of a state jefe were
incompatible. He chose the latter, and was most unfortunate
in the discharge of its duties. There being
then no vice-president, José Gregorio Salazar had
charge of the executive in 1834 as the senior senator,
Morazan having for a time, and with the permission of
the senate, absented himself. Upon being elected on
the 2d of June, Salazar continued in charge, and it was
by his order that the federal authorities transferred
themselves to the city of Santa Ana during San
Martin's insurrection against the national government.
The day after the inauguration of Morazan for the
second presidential term, congress closed its session.<a name='FA_VI-47' id='FA_VI-47' href='#FN_VI-47' class='fnanchor'>[VI-47]</a>
</p>

<p>
No important event affecting the confederation occurred
during the remainder of 1835, but the atmosphere
was filled with folly and misrule, foreboding
the storm which was to make of Central America for
many a day the theatre of the bloodiest of civil wars.
</p>

<p class="p2">
It has been shown that the party in power pursued
in general a liberal policy—too liberal, in fact, as later
events proved. In view of the tardy development of
the country in the old way, inducements were offered
for foreign immigration, and an English company was
organized for the purpose of fostering colonization in
the department of Vera Paz.<a name='FA_VI-48' id='FA_VI-48' href='#FN_VI-48' class='fnanchor'>[VI-48]</a> Settlers were sent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_123' name='Page_123' href='#Page_123'>123</a></span>

but the scheme failed because of unskilful and dishonest
management.<a name='FA_VI-49' id='FA_VI-49' href='#FN_VI-49' class='fnanchor'>[VI-49]</a> Nevertheless, the servile party
turned this incident to account, filling the minds of
the lower classes, especially the Indians, with prejudice
against the government, which it accused of an intent
to exterminate the native population by throwing
open the country to foreign influence, religion, and
administration of justice. The innovations in this
last respect had, more than anything else, imbittered
the natives, and on the 6th of March led to an outbreak
at Ostuncalco, where the Indians had become
irritated at being compelled to work at the construction
of prisons.<a name='FA_VI-50' id='FA_VI-50' href='#FN_VI-50' class='fnanchor'>[VI-50]</a> An armed force was sent to quell
the disturbance, out of which the judges and some
officials had great difficulty to escape with life.

REVOLT AND CHOLERA.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely was this trouble over when a worse one
stole in—the cholera. The scourge began its ravages
in Central America early in 1837,<a name='FA_VI-51' id='FA_VI-51' href='#FN_VI-51' class='fnanchor'>[VI-51]</a> and soon spread
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_124' name='Page_124' href='#Page_124'>124</a></span>
throughout the towns of the republic. The governments
of the different states, and notably that of
Guatemala, used the utmost efforts to relieve suffering.
Physicians and medical students, provided with
medicines, were despatched to the several districts.
But their efforts were largely frustrated by the opposition
of the servile party, which never ceased its work
even in these days of awful distress. Determined to
bring to an end the influence of the liberals, the servile
party hesitated at nothing. All means to that end
were made available. The priests made the ignorant
masses believe that the waters had been poisoned in
order to destroy the natives and make way for foreigners.<a name='FA_VI-52' id='FA_VI-52' href='#FN_VI-52' class='fnanchor'>[VI-52]</a>
Their deviltry was crowned with success.
The low murmurs of hatred soon swelled to loud cries
of vengeance against the government and foreign residents.
Several physicians became the victims of
popular fury, being put to death with cruel tortures.<a name='FA_VI-53' id='FA_VI-53' href='#FN_VI-53' class='fnanchor'>[VI-53]</a>
Others barely escaped death. The greatest violence
was in the district of Mita, where it assumed the
form of a general insurrection. The government despatched
a body of troops to dissolve a large assemblage
of insurrectionists. The instructions were to
use gentle means to allay the disturbance, resorting
to force only in case of necessity. The magistrate of
the district, having imprudently left the strong body
of infantry behind, had no sooner attempted to explain
his mission than the mob fell upon him and his
guard of forty dragoons, killing a number of them and
putting the rest to flight. This was on the 9th of
June.<a name='FA_VI-54' id='FA_VI-54' href='#FN_VI-54' class='fnanchor'>[VI-54]</a> The leader of the mob on this occasion was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
Rafael Carrera, a mixed-breed, who now for the first
time, at the age of twenty-one, possibly a few years
older, appeared on the stage, to become afterward the
bitterest foe of the liberal party, and eventually the
dictator of the country.

RAFAEL CARRERA.

<p class="p2">
Rafael Carrera was a native of Guatemala, of Indian
descent, of a violent, irascible, and uncommunicative
disposition, base-born, ignorant, though gifted
with talents, bold, determined, and persevering. From
common servant he became a pig-driver, and while
such obtained much influence among the lower class
of Indians—an influence which was due no less to
his blood connections and the force of circumstances
than to his bravery and capabilities.<a name='FA_VI-55' id='FA_VI-55' href='#FN_VI-55' class='fnanchor'>[VI-55]</a>

Only a week after the success of the insurgents on
the field of Ambelis, a numerous armed force was sent
against them by the government, which achieved
victory near Mataquescuintla.<a name='FA_VII-1' id='FA_VII-1' href='#FN_VII-1' class='fnanchor'>[VII-1]</a> The revolution might
have ended here but for the excesses of the government
troops, which roused the Indians, and rendered

one of races. Carrera, upheld as he was by the
priests, found no difficulty, in his visits from village to
village, to induce the native population to join the
revolt, which, notwithstanding the triumphant language
of the military officers in their reports—calling
the rebels cowards and themselves intrepid and invincible—was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_128' name='Page_128' href='#Page_128'>128</a></span>
fast spreading. Carefully avoiding
encounters with the regular army, Carrera succeeded
in getting together a large force, which, though raw
and undisciplined, often surprised and defeated detachments
of the regulars, seeking a refuge when pursued
in the inaccessible mountain fastnesses.<a name='FA_VII-3' id='FA_VII-3' href='#FN_VII-3' class='fnanchor'>[VII-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
To make matters worse, the departments of Sacatepequez,
Chiquimula, and Salamá, declared themselves
independent of the government, and the rebels
of the first district,<a name='FA_VII-4' id='FA_VII-4' href='#FN_VII-4' class='fnanchor'>[VII-4]</a> concentrating at La Antigua,
threatened to attack the capital. In the latter place
a division had occurred in the liberal party,<a name='FA_VII-5' id='FA_VII-5' href='#FN_VII-5' class='fnanchor'>[VII-5]</a> some of
whose members from this time sided with the serviles;
which circumstance made it more difficult to place
the city of Guatemala in a proper state of defence.
A mutiny of the federal troops in the city<a name='FA_VII-6' id='FA_VII-6' href='#FN_VII-6' class='fnanchor'>[VII-6]</a> increased
the danger, but it soon was quelled with the execution
of the ringleader. On the 27th of January, 1838,<a name='FA_VII-7' id='FA_VII-7' href='#FN_VII-7' class='fnanchor'>[VII-7]</a>
Galvez despatched the vice-president, José Gregorio
Salazar, and the secretary of relations, Miguel Álvarez,
as commissioners, to confer with General Carrascosa,
the commander of the rebel forces, and bring
about an amicable arrangement. The commissioners
signed at Guarda Viejo<a name='FA_VII-8' id='FA_VII-8' href='#FN_VII-8' class='fnanchor'>[VII-8]</a> a convention containing the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_129' name='Page_129' href='#Page_129'>129</a></span>
following stipulations: 1st, resignation of Galvez; 2d,
occupation of the capital by the forces of Sacatepequez;
3d, the forces in the capital to go out, and place
themselves under the orders of General Morazan; 4th,
the forces of Sacatepequez to guarantee the persons
and property of all; 5th, the commissioners would
arrange the manner of evacuating the city; 6th, upon
the ratification of these clauses, they were to be carried
out within twenty-four hours. Nothing was
done, however,<a name='FA_VII-9' id='FA_VII-9' href='#FN_VII-9' class='fnanchor'>[VII-9]</a> and after four hours' waiting, Carrascosa
continued his march toward the gate of Buenavista,

ATTACK ON GUATEMALA.
</p>

<p>
Sacatepequez' force, 800 strong, entered the capital
during the night of the 29th of January, from the
Calvario side, reaching the plazuela de San Francisco,
afterward known as plaza de la Concordia. The roar
of artillery apprised the inhabitants at 1 o'clock in
the morning that the struggle had begun. Generals
Prem and Gorris, colonels Yañez, Arias, Mariscal,
Cerda, and Córdoba, and the other officers of the
garrison, made a stout defence. Their troops, though
inferior in number, were for their discipline more efficient
than their assailants, who were mostly raw
recruits. It was quite evident that Carrascosa and
his colleague Carballo would waste their efforts unless
they were strongly reënforced. But the opponents of
Galvez were resolved to depose him,<a name='FA_VII-11' id='FA_VII-11' href='#FN_VII-11' class='fnanchor'>[VII-11]</a> even if they
had to make use of Carrera to accomplish their purpose.
It was a fatal thought.
</p>

<p>
José F. Barrundia was authorized by President Morazan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_130' name='Page_130' href='#Page_130'>130</a></span>
to enter into peaceable negotiations with Carrera,
and the clergymen José María de Castilla, Manuel
María Zeceña, and José Vicente Orantes. Barrundia,
together with Manuel Arrivillaga, started for the
hacienda of La Vega to confer with Carrera; but at
Ojo de Agua they ascertained that he was at Mataquescuintla,
and declined to hold any conferences, and
yet an arrangement with other opponents had been
signed at Santa Rosa. This document, which was
shown by Father Duran to Barrundia, stipulated the
immediate coming of a bishop, the abolition of the
code and of other liberal measures decreed by Barrundia,
and that Carrera should become the commander
of the reform forces, or in other words, the arbiter
of the country, which was what the clergy wanted.
Barrundia was indignant, but he had to submit and
keep calm, else he might lose his life. He merely
said that the arrangement needed some discussion,
which might lead to the adoption of some amendments.
Duran had not worked to promote Barrundia's
nor Molina's ideas, but his own interests. He
coolly replied that the matter had been well considered,
and admitted of no changes.
</p>

<p>
Barrundia wrote Carrera, asking for an interview to
explain Morazan's views, but Carrera appeared angry

invitation, saying that the time for negotiations had
passed, and that his march against Guatemala was in
order.<a name='FA_VII-12' id='FA_VII-12' href='#FN_VII-12' class='fnanchor'>[VII-12]</a> He became much mollified on receiving from
La Antigua a request for his coöperation,<a name='FA_VII-13' id='FA_VII-13' href='#FN_VII-13' class='fnanchor'>[VII-13]</a> and was
now satisfied that the fate of the country was in his own
hands. Three days after Carrascosa's failure, Carrera
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_131' name='Page_131' href='#Page_131'>131</a></span>
joined him with a numerous force of Indians, and after
some fruitless negotiations, marched into the city on
the 1st of February,<a name='FA_VII-14' id='FA_VII-14' href='#FN_VII-14' class='fnanchor'>[VII-14]</a> at the head of about 10,000
men, women, and children, the troops of the government
having retreated in an opposite direction. The
result of this was that Galvez ceased to be the jefe of
the state, and was succeeded by the vice-jefe, Pedro
Valenzuela.<a name='FA_VII-15' id='FA_VII-15' href='#FN_VII-15' class='fnanchor'>[VII-15]</a>

CARRERA TAKES THE CAPITAL.
</p>

<p>
The entry of Carrera's hordes into Guatemala might
well create consternation. Outlaws and robbers were
among the leaders; the soldiers were in rags,<a name='FA_VII-16' id='FA_VII-16' href='#FN_VII-16' class='fnanchor'>[VII-16]</a> and
equipped with a variety of arms, from the rusty
musket down to clubs, and knives secured at the end
of long poles, while others carried sticks shaped like
muskets, with tin-plate locks. Conspicuous among
the mass of followers were thousands of women having
bags to carry away the booty, and who gazed with
amazement on the fine houses.<a name='FA_VII-17' id='FA_VII-17' href='#FN_VII-17' class='fnanchor'>[VII-17]</a> Shouting 'Viva la
religion! Mueran los extranjeros!' the invaders entered
the main plaza. After a few hours the work of
rapine began.<a name='FA_VII-18' id='FA_VII-18' href='#FN_VII-18' class='fnanchor'>[VII-18]</a> No regard was paid by Carrera and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
his hordes to the wishes of the vice-jefe Valenzuela,
who had asked that only the force from La Antigua
should occupy the plaza.
</p>

<p>
The leader of the opposition urged Carrera to leave
the city; but he manifested much indignation at such
a request, and several of his chiefs refused compliance.
Carrera himself wanted to sack the city,<a name='FA_VII-19' id='FA_VII-19' href='#FN_VII-19' class='fnanchor'>[VII-19]</a> and it was
only with great effort that he was prevented. In
lieu of pillage he was given $11,000,<a name='FA_VII-20' id='FA_VII-20' href='#FN_VII-20' class='fnanchor'>[VII-20]</a> $10,000 for his
troops and $1,000 for himself. He was also flattered
with the commission of lieutenant-colonel and the
appointment of comandante of Mita. A number of
those who had defended the city having voluntarily
joined the Sacatepequez force, Carrascosa was now
better able to meet emergencies. He at once, by
order of the vice-jefe, made known to Carrera that
the interests of the public service demanded that he
should repair to Mita and take charge of the comandancia
there. He made no resistance, and went away
with his horde,<a name='FA_VII-21' id='FA_VII-21' href='#FN_VII-21' class='fnanchor'>[VII-21]</a> the inhabitants again breathing
freely for a time.<a name='FA_VII-22' id='FA_VII-22' href='#FN_VII-22' class='fnanchor'>[VII-22]</a> Thus were the serviles balked
once more. Carrera was sent away from Guatemala,
Valenzuela remaining in charge of the state executive.
Morazan was at San Salvador recognized as
the chief magistrate of the republic, and Vijil held
the executive office of that gallant little state.

<p class="sidenote">
MORAZAN VERSUS CARRERA.
</p>

<p>
Carrera and his supporters continued, however,
their menaces, creating no little alarm, which was
quieted on receipt of the tidings that Morazan was
marching toward Guatemala with 1,500 men. On
his arrival he found not only that the serviles had
been deriving advantages from the disturbed political
situation, but that the western departments of Los
Altos, namely, Quezaltenango, Totonicapan, and Sololá,
had declared themselves, on the 2d of February,
a separate state under an independent government.<a name='FA_VII-23' id='FA_VII-23' href='#FN_VII-23' class='fnanchor'>[VII-23]</a>
Without interfering with those arrangements, Morazan
endeavored to secure by peaceful means the
submission of Carrera, or rather, the disbanding of his
force; failing in which, he opened, on the 30th of
March, the campaign against him. Three months
of military operations ensued, the federal arms being
victorious at every encounter, but without obtaining
any definitive result, for the enemy defeated in one
place rallied in another, continually increasing in numbers,
and never crushed.<a name='FA_VII-24' id='FA_VII-24' href='#FN_VII-24' class='fnanchor'>[VII-24]</a> Morazan returned at last
to Guatemala, where in the mean time servile influence
had become predominant.<a name='FA_VII-25' id='FA_VII-25' href='#FN_VII-25' class='fnanchor'>[VII-25]</a> The most strenuous efforts,
even to fulsome sycophancy, were used by the

serviles to win him to their side, and to prevail on him
to accept the dictatorship.<a name='FA_VII-26' id='FA_VII-26' href='#FN_VII-26' class='fnanchor'>[VII-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
The president returned in July to San Salvador to
quell a revolt. A few weeks later, on the 20th of
July, 1838, the eleventh and last federal congress of
Central America, presided over by Basilio Porras,
closed its session.<a name='FA_VII-27' id='FA_VII-27' href='#FN_VII-27' class='fnanchor'>[VII-27]</a> Subsequent efforts to bring it
again into life proved unavailing, and from this time
the dismemberment of the republic made rapid progress.
Two days after the adjournment of congress,
on the 22d, the state government of Guatemala was
also dissolved, and was temporarily intrusted to the
federal authorities,<a name='FA_VII-28' id='FA_VII-28' href='#FN_VII-28' class='fnanchor'>[VII-28]</a> though the executive office finally
was assumed by Mariano Rivera Paz, as president of
the council, which satisfied the people, and peace was
unbroken, it being understood that a constituent
assembly would be summoned at once.

<p class="sidenote">
SALAZAR DEFEATS CARRERA.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Morazan was at some distance from
Guatemala on his way to San Salvador, Carrera, the
supposed beaten rebel leader, for whose capture a liberal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_135' name='Page_135' href='#Page_135'>135</a></span>
reward had been offered,<a name='FA_VII-29' id='FA_VII-29' href='#FN_VII-29' class='fnanchor'>[VII-29]</a> began to show signs of
rallying. He gathered a numerous force, with which,
about the middle of August, he defeated the federal
troops, first at Jalapa and next at Petapa. He then,
unresisted, took possession of La Antigua, a portion of
which was pillaged, and forthwith started on his march
for Guatemala.<a name='FA_VII-30' id='FA_VII-30' href='#FN_VII-30' class='fnanchor'>[VII-30]</a> A general clamor for Morazan was
aroused; but it was impossible for him to reach Guatemala
in time, and the danger was imminent that Carrera
would not only take the city, but also carry out
his threats of burning every house in it. In this
emergency, General Cárlos Salazar, with the garrison
of 900 men, sallied forth, and aided by a thick fog,
surprised Carrera at Villanueva, where the latter was
concentrating his forces, now about 2,400 strong, with
the plunder secured at La Antigua. A battle ensued,
the bloodiest that occurred in 1837 or 1838, and Carrera
was routed,<a name='FA_VII-31' id='FA_VII-31' href='#FN_VII-31' class='fnanchor'>[VII-31]</a> with the loss of 350 killed and 24
prisoners, one of whom was the notorious Father
Duran, the representative and agent of the aristocrats
near the person of Carrera;<a name='FA_VII-32' id='FA_VII-32' href='#FN_VII-32' class='fnanchor'>[VII-32]</a> besides giving up a
number of federal prisoners and losing three pieces
of artillery, 305 muskets, and a large number of other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
arms, besides ammunition. A portion of the defeated
forces fled to La Antigua, and a smaller one joined the
rebel Mangandí, who had 500 men. The latter, being
ignorant of Carrera's mishap, approached Guatemala
on the 11th, at 10 o'clock in the morning, causing no
little commotion; but on learning of his leader's defeat,
he retired to the mountains. The war might have
ended here had the victors followed up their success;
but petty annoyances prevented Salazar from doing
so, and he threw up his command in disgust,<a name='FA_VII-33' id='FA_VII-33' href='#FN_VII-33' class='fnanchor'>[VII-33]</a> though
he was afterward induced to resume it.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of the clergy friendly to Carrera
never forsook him. It was not so with the aristocrats,
Manuel Pavon, Luis Batres, and Pedro and Juan
Jose Aycinena, who feared at times that they could
not control him. After his defeat at Villanueva they
called him an '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">antropófago sediento de sangre humana.</span>'<a name='FA_VII-34' id='FA_VII-34' href='#FN_VII-34' class='fnanchor'>[VII-34]</a>
At that time they asked the vicar-general,
Larrazábal, to fulminate censures against Carrera,
which he did.<a name='FA_VII-35' id='FA_VII-35' href='#FN_VII-35' class='fnanchor'>[VII-35]</a> Friar Bernardo Piñol also railed
against him from the pulpit in the cathedral.<a name='FA_VII-36' id='FA_VII-36' href='#FN_VII-36' class='fnanchor'>[VII-36]</a> However,
not long afterward Carrera was called from that
same pulpit '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">hijo predilecto del Altísimo.</span>'
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
CARRERA AGAIN DEFEATED.
</p>

<p>
The lack of energy on the part of the authorities
after the affair of Villanueva<a name='FA_VII-37' id='FA_VII-37' href='#FN_VII-37' class='fnanchor'>[VII-37]</a> enabled Carrera to reorganize
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
his forces, with which he made a successful
raid, in the latter part of October, against Ahuachapan
and Santa Ana,<a name='FA_VII-38' id='FA_VII-38' href='#FN_VII-38' class='fnanchor'>[VII-38]</a> returning afterward to Guatemala,
when, on the 4th of November, he was attacked
in Chiquimulilla by Colonel Carballo, defeated, and
driven back to the mountain recesses of Mita.<a name='FA_VII-39' id='FA_VII-39' href='#FN_VII-39' class='fnanchor'>[VII-39]</a> Morazan
had in the mean time concentrated forces in
Guatemala, and aided Carballo's operations by marching
against the Indian chieftain from a northern direction.
But all efforts to crush the enemy failed,
though the federal troops were everywhere victorious;
many of Carrera's followers were taken and shot, but
he always managed to escape.<a name='FA_VII-40' id='FA_VII-40' href='#FN_VII-40' class='fnanchor'>[VII-40]</a> This warfare, or
rather chase, was kept up nearly two months. At
last a capitulation was concluded, on the 23d of December,
at Rinconcito. Carrera and his followers
were to surrender their arms<a name='FA_VII-41' id='FA_VII-41' href='#FN_VII-41' class='fnanchor'>[VII-41]</a> and recognize the government,
which in turn was to confirm the former in
his office of comandante of the district of Mita, and
respect the lives and property of its inhabitants.<a name='FA_VII-42' id='FA_VII-42' href='#FN_VII-42' class='fnanchor'>[VII-42]</a>
Thus was Carrera a second time given a legal standing.
General Guzman, who treated with him, seemed
to place on the treacherous and barbarous mountaineer
the same faith as if he were a civilized man and a respecter
of treaty stipulations.<a name='FA_VII-43' id='FA_VII-43' href='#FN_VII-43' class='fnanchor'>[VII-43]</a> The agreement was
not carried out by Carrera, for he delivered only a
small portion of useless arms, and kept his force under
the pretext that the safety of his district demanded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
it. The government not only had the weakness to
enter into this arrangement, but also that of not enforcing
its fulfilment to the letter. This rendered
the renewal of hostilities but a question of time.
</p>

<p>
I have mentioned the congressional decree of May
30, 1838, granting the states the privilege of acting
as best suited their views. This was tantamount to
a dissolution of the union; and when Morazan's second
presidential term expired, on the 1st of February,
1839,<a name='FA_VII-44' id='FA_VII-44' href='#FN_VII-44' class='fnanchor'>[VII-44]</a> not even an outward tie remained to hold together
the several states. Morazan, and he alone, did
not relinquish all hope of restoring the republic, and
without delivering up an office which had ceased to
exist, the strife was continued under his leadership.
His efforts, supported by force though they were, met
with resistance on the part of Nicaragua and Honduras,
united by a treaty of alliance since January
18, 1839, which had been entered into for the purpose
of maintaining the independence and sovereignty
of the two states.<a name='FA_VII-45' id='FA_VII-45' href='#FN_VII-45' class='fnanchor'>[VII-45]</a> Similar agreements were made
in the following months between nearly all the other
states, always protesting a willingness to form a federal
convention of the Central American states, but
opposing the idea of confederation.<a name='FA_VII-46' id='FA_VII-46' href='#FN_VII-46' class='fnanchor'>[VII-46]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
FIGHTING IN SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
A conciliatory spirit, to bring to an end the war
against Salvador, and to act as mediator, was effected
in these treaties; but it had no influence for good,
and the hostilities continued between Nicaragua and
Honduras on the one part, and Salvador on the other.
Troops of the two former states entered Salvador territory
in March 1839, and surprising a federal party
at the crossings of the Lempa River, called Xicaral
and Petacones, took without resistance the town of
San Vicente; but having advanced to the heights of
Xiboa, were repulsed and beaten by Colonel Narciso
Benitez.<a name='FA_VII-47' id='FA_VII-47' href='#FN_VII-47' class='fnanchor'>[VII-47]</a> The allies were signally defeated at Espíritu
Santo, near the Lempa, by the Salvadorans, called
federals, under Morazan, on the 6th of April.<a name='FA_VII-48' id='FA_VII-48' href='#FN_VII-48' class='fnanchor'>[VII-48]</a>
Equally successful were Morazan's operations during
the rest of the year. His officers invaded Honduras,
took the capital and Tegucigalpa, and routed the allies
in several encounters.<a name='FA_VII-49' id='FA_VII-49' href='#FN_VII-49' class='fnanchor'>[VII-49]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_140' name='Page_140' href='#Page_140'>140</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But affairs underwent a change against him early in
the following year. A joint force of Nicaraguans and
Hondurans, under Manuel Quijano,<a name='FA_VII-50' id='FA_VII-50' href='#FN_VII-50' class='fnanchor'>[VII-50]</a> attacked the
federals under Cabañas at the hacienda del Potrero,
on the 31st of January, 1840, and forced them to leave
the state of Honduras.<a name='FA_VII-51' id='FA_VII-51' href='#FN_VII-51' class='fnanchor'>[VII-51]</a> A formidable servile coalition
was being formed against Morazan. Nicaragua
was resolved to drive this jefe of Salvador from the
executive chair. Honduras, under Jáuregui, was controlled
by Quijano's sword. Los Altos had become
again a department of Guatemala, which was subject
to Carrera's will. This chieftain, in his pronunciamiento
of March 24, 1839, had avowed his intention
to champion the sovereignty of the several states as
concordant with his own ideas.<a name='FA_VII-52' id='FA_VII-52' href='#FN_VII-52' class='fnanchor'>[VII-52]</a> Morazan thought
the situation might be saved with an extraordinarily
bold move, attacking the serviles in their headquarters,
and made preparation to bring matters to a final
issue in the city of Guatemala. The serviles, on their
part, pursuing their aim of overthrowing Morazan,
entered into a league with Carrera, and invited him
to take possession of Guatemala.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
TRIUMPH AND DEFEAT OF MORAZAN.
</p>

<p>
Morazan convoked the assembly of Salvador, and
caused the vice-jefe, Silva, to assume the executive
office of the state, in order to enable himself to take
command of the forces for the campaign in Guatemala,
which at first amounted to 900 men. He was
afterward joined by many who had been persecuted
by the aristocrats, who pledged themselves to conquer
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_141' name='Page_141' href='#Page_141'>141</a></span>
or perish at his side, and faithfully carried out
the promise.<a name='FA_VII-53' id='FA_VII-53' href='#FN_VII-53' class='fnanchor'>[VII-53]</a> Morazan marched upon the city of
Guatemala, and his movement created the greatest
alarm when he neared Corral de Piedra. Consternation
then seized the serviles.<a name='FA_VII-54' id='FA_VII-54' href='#FN_VII-54' class='fnanchor'>[VII-54]</a> Preparations were
made, however, for defence. All men capable of bearing
arms were called to the service,<a name='FA_VII-55' id='FA_VII-55' href='#FN_VII-55' class='fnanchor'>[VII-55]</a> and Carrera
established his headquarters at Aceituno, his plan
being to catch the men of Salvador between the fortifications
of the city and his own force.<a name='FA_VII-56' id='FA_VII-56' href='#FN_VII-56' class='fnanchor'>[VII-56]</a> The plan
failed. Morazan entered the city on the 18th of March
at sunrise, by the Buenavista gate, and after some
fighting, made himself master of it, and of all the
defences.<a name='FA_VII-57' id='FA_VII-57' href='#FN_VII-57' class='fnanchor'>[VII-57]</a> Liberals who were in the prisons were
set free. Among them was General Agustin Guzman,
whom Carrera had outrageously treated, confining
him shackled in a dungeon. Guzman hailed the
victor who returned him to freedom, but was unable to
afford any aid; the shackles had made him a cripple.
The numerous prisoners taken were all treated with
every kindness. Such had always been his practice.
However, it was not destined that he should enjoy his
victory. Carrera attacked him on the next day—the
19th—and after a fight of twenty-two hours, compelled
Morazan to retreat.<a name='FA_VII-58' id='FA_VII-58' href='#FN_VII-58' class='fnanchor'>[VII-58]</a> His forces had been shattered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
at the Calvario. The number of assailants, known
as cachurecos, was overwhelming.<a name='FA_VII-59' id='FA_VII-59' href='#FN_VII-59' class='fnanchor'>[VII-59]</a> At 4 o'clock in
the morning he left the city by the plaza de Guadalupe
with upwards of 400 men, and was far away
before the escape became known. No pursuit of the
fugitives was attempted.<a name='FA_VII-60' id='FA_VII-60' href='#FN_VII-60' class='fnanchor'>[VII-60]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
FALL OF MORAZAN.
</p>

<p>
On arriving at San Salvador, Morazan found the
tables turned against him. He was openly insulted
in the streets; and becoming convinced that it would
be impossible to raise a new army and continue the
war, he concluded to cease the struggle and leave the
country. He accordingly called a meeting and made
known the necessity of such a course in order to save
the state from anarchy. On the 5th of April he embarked
at La Libertad upon the schooner <i>Izalco</i>, together
with Vice-president Vijil and thirty-five of his
supporters.<a name='FA_VII-61' id='FA_VII-61' href='#FN_VII-61' class='fnanchor'>[VII-61]</a> The vessel reached Puntarenas, where
the chief of Costa Rica, Braulio Carrillo, who had
congratulated Guatemala on the defeat of Morazan,
refused him residence in the state, though it was
granted to some of his companions.<a name='FA_VII-62' id='FA_VII-62' href='#FN_VII-62' class='fnanchor'>[VII-62]</a> Morazan and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
his remaining companions continued their voyage to
South America, where he remained about two years.
After a time, touching at David, in Colombia, he
issued a stirring manifesto to the Central American
people.<a name='FA_VII-63' id='FA_VII-63' href='#FN_VII-63' class='fnanchor'>[VII-63]</a> He was the last champion of the 'Confederacion
de Centro América,' whose establishment
had been greeted with so much joy on the 1st of July,
1823.
</p>

<p>
The governments of Nicaragua and Honduras,
which had promised Guatemala aid to resist Morazan,
on hearing of his downfall congratulated the victor on
the defeat of the 'common enemy of all the states.'
They thought that with the fall of Morazan, Central
American nationality would be revived. They could
not yet see that they had been the dupes of the aristocrats
and their clerical allies in Guatemala, who,
while holding out the promise of reuniting Central
America, had been all along working for the destruction
of federal nationality.
</p>

<p>
After the departure of Morazan and Vijil, Antonio
José Cañas, by virtue of his position as a councillor
of state, assumed the rulership of Salvador, and
called the assembly to hold a special session. It was
expected that, Morazan being out of the way,<a name='FA_VII-64' id='FA_VII-64' href='#FN_VII-64' class='fnanchor'>[VII-64]</a> with
so honorable and upright a man as Cañas at the head,
concord would be restored. But Salvador was still
the subject of abuses, and on the remonstrances of
Cañas, the government of Guatemala despatched a
diplomatic mission to San Salvador. It was composed
of the former pig-driver Rafael Carrera, and
Joaquin Duran, and had for an attaché Francisco
Malespin, a military officer whose sword had been dyed
in the best blood of Quezaltenango.<a name='FA_VII-65' id='FA_VII-65' href='#FN_VII-65' class='fnanchor'>[VII-65]</a> A convention
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
was concluded on the 13th of May, 1840, placing Salvador
at the mercy of Guatemala, Cañas having to submit
to the conditions imposed.<a name='FA_VII-66' id='FA_VII-66' href='#FN_VII-66' class='fnanchor'>[VII-66]</a> The most humiliating
condition of the understanding was not mentioned
in the convention, namely, that the attaché Francisco
Malespin should remain in San Salvador, with the
office of comandante de armas. This treaty convinced
the people of Salvador that they could expect no favor
from the aristocracy of Guatemala, their implacable
foe.

<p>
Having sketched the life of Central America, first
as an appendage of the Spanish crown, next as a portion
of the short-lived Mexican empire, and lastly as
a confederation of states, embracing the period from
1801 to 1840, it is well now to glance over the internal
affairs of each state separately, for the period after
its accession to the federal union down to 1840, beginning
with Guatemala as the most important.
</p>

<p>
I have said elsewhere that the states were organized
on the same principle as the confederation,
namely, under a popular, democratic, representative
government. The first constituent congress or assembly
of the Estado de Guatemala was installed at
La Antigua on the 16th of September, 1824,<a name='FA_VIII-1' id='FA_VIII-1' href='#FN_VIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-1]</a> under
the presidency of the clergyman José María Chacon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
and its first act was to call Alejandro Diaz Cabeza de
Vaca to be the provisional chief of the state.<a name='FA_VIII-2' id='FA_VIII-2' href='#FN_VIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-2]</a> On
the 30th, the votes for jefe and vice-jefe having been
counted, and neither of the candidates having the
requisite majority, the congress named Juan Barrundia
to be jefe and Cirilo Flores to be vice-jefe, the
former assuming the reins of government on the 12th

was allowed to have a voice in public affairs. However,
no open rupture occurred, even during a tumult

recognizing the constitution of the republic. The
rabble supported the friars,<a name='FA_VIII-4' id='FA_VIII-4' href='#FN_VIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-4]</a> but owing to the energetic
attitude of the state government, the priests had
to submit.

<p>
The assembly continued its labors. A coat of arms
was decreed January 20, 1825, and on the 2d of
May took place the installation of the executive
council, whose prerogatives and duties were similar
in state matters to those of the federal senate in national
affairs. On the same date was also installed
the superior court of justice. The framing of a state
constitution was not completed till the 11th of October,

BARRUNDIA AS JEFE.
</p>

<p>
The liberal party has been accused of having, with
the connivance of the jefe Barrundia, committed
frauds at the elections held in January 1826 for a
partial renewal of the representative council. In the
first ordinary legislature, which met on the 1st of
February, a law was passed for new elections to fill
the council. But these and other arbitrary measures
of the liberal party gave rise to such warm discussions
in the assembly, that Barrundia at last ignored
the authority of the council as then existing.<a name='FA_VIII-7' id='FA_VIII-7' href='#FN_VIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-7]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'>148</a></span>
latter then denounced him, and called the vice-jefe to
assume the government. But through the mediation
of commissioners of the federal government, harmony
was restored. This harmony was not to last long,
new complications arising from another quarter. I
have, in detailing federal affairs at this period, spoken
of the plans attributed to president Arce to overthrow
the liberal party, and the events which culminated
with the deposal of Barrundia from his position as
jefe of the state. The first resolution taken by the
legislature and representative council was to remove
the capital to Quezaltenango. The new jefe, Flores,
was at the same time empowered to organize a military
force, raise funds, and adopt other proper measures
to uphold the state's sovereignty.<a name='FA_VIII-8' id='FA_VIII-8' href='#FN_VIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-8]</a> Flores had
advocated the removal of the state capital, but strenuously
opposed the selection of Quezaltenango as an
unfit place for the seat of government of a liberal
state.<a name='FA_VIII-9' id='FA_VIII-9' href='#FN_VIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-9]</a> The assembly paid some heed to his remonstrances,
and tarried a while at San Martin Jilotepec,
where it was resolved that Barrundia should resume
the reins of government; but he declined, pleading
ill health.<a name='FA_VIII-10' id='FA_VIII-10' href='#FN_VIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-10]</a> The assembly remained at that place till
the 29th of September, and then concluded to repair
to Quezaltenango, considering Jilotepec not quite safe.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PIERZON'S CAMPAIGN.
</p>

<p>
Flores, accompanied by a few deputies, arrived at
Quezaltenango on the 8th of October, and was received
with a shower of flowers. He at once set
himself to complete the defence of the district, which
had been already begun by Colonel José Pierzon,<a name='FA_VIII-11' id='FA_VIII-11' href='#FN_VIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-11]</a>
who had mustered into the service of the state several
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
hundred men.<a name='FA_VIII-12' id='FA_VIII-12' href='#FN_VIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-12]</a> Having reason to apprehend an
attack from the federal authority, Pierzon was ordered
to <a name="Patsun" id="Patsun"></a>Patsun to watch the enemy. It was during
his absence that the events occurred leading to the
murder of Jefe Flores by an ungovernable fanatical
mob, of which a description is given elsewhere. Upon
hearing of those occurrences, and of the friars at
Quezaltenango having called the Indians of the neighborhood
to take up arms for the common defence,
Pierzon retreated to Totonicapan,<a name='FA_VIII-13' id='FA_VIII-13' href='#FN_VIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-13]</a> encountering the
Quezaltec rebels on the 18th of October near Salcajá,
and easily defeated them. He gave no quarter. He
demanded the immediate surrender of all arms in
Quezaltenango, guaranteeing the lives of the inhabitants,
otherwise he would destroy the place.<a name='FA_VIII-14' id='FA_VIII-14' href='#FN_VIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-14]</a> The
rebel authorities had to submit, and on the following
day Pierzon recovered possession of the place. Several
draconic ordinances were issued to keep in check
the spirit of rebellion.<a name='FA_VIII-15' id='FA_VIII-15' href='#FN_VIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-15]</a> The leaders of the riots had,
however, fled, thus escaping the punishment they so
richly deserved.
</p>

<p>
Juan Barrundia now made another effort, from
Sololá, to resume his former authority, but his prestige
was lost, and most of his friends had forsaken his
cause.<a name='FA_VIII-16' id='FA_VIII-16' href='#FN_VIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-16]</a> Pierzon abandoned Quezaltenango on the
25th of October, and was pursued, overtaken, and defeated
by the federals, under Brigadier Cáscaras, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
Malacatan.<a name='FA_VIII-17' id='FA_VIII-17' href='#FN_VIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-17]</a> Pierzon, together with his friends Saget
and Fauconnier, escaped, and were proscribed, but
they managed to cross into Chiapas.<a name='FA_VIII-18' id='FA_VIII-18' href='#FN_VIII-18' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-18]</a> But it seemed
that it had been preordained that he should perish at
the hands of his foes. On his way to San Salvador
to take part in the war against the federal government,
he was taken prisoner, brought to Guatemala,
and shot, on the 11th of May, 1827, without a trial.<a name='FA_VIII-19' id='FA_VIII-19' href='#FN_VIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-19]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another body of liberal troops, under Cayetano de
la Cerda, not being aware of Pierzon's defeat at Malacatan,
prepared to march from Los Altos to Guatemala,
but the soldiers were induced to rebel, and thus
the last armed force of the state disappeared. The
members of the assembly and council who were not
in prison either secreted themselves or emigrated, and
the state was left without authorities. The federal
president assumed power, and replaced the jefes políticos
and military commanders with his own creatures.
He published, on the 31st of October, a decree for
new elections of state authorities. The new assembly
met on the last day of the year, and on the 1st of
March, 1827, Mariano Aycinena was chosen by popular
vote chief of the state.<a name='FA_VIII-20' id='FA_VIII-20' href='#FN_VIII-20' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-20]</a> It is hardly necessary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
to state that the elections were wholly controlled by
the servile party, whose views were reflected in the
new jefe's policy. Lest the existing courts should not
deal to the liberals subjected to criminal prosecution
such punishments as their enemies desired, a military
court, with three voting members, was created, to adjudicate
verbally upon all causes for treason.<a name='FA_VIII-21' id='FA_VIII-21' href='#FN_VIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-21]</a> During
the seven months of its existence—to the 29th

upwards of ten persons, but the sentence was carried
out in one case only.<a name='FA_VIII-22' id='FA_VIII-22' href='#FN_VIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-22]</a>

RULE OF AYCINENA.
</p>

<p>
The history of Guatemala during Aycinena's rule
was identical with that of the federal government,
this jefe being a supporter of President Arce, and
affording him all possible aid in his warfare against
Salvador, all of which has been narrated. Toward
the end of 1828, however, the successes of the arms
of Salvador, together with certain alleged false steps
of Aycinena,<a name='FA_VIII-23' id='FA_VIII-23' href='#FN_VIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-23]</a> aroused such a spirit of discontent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
against him and his administration, that on the 20th
of October the assembly passed an act for the renewal
of all the chief authorities of the state.<a name='FA_VIII-24' id='FA_VIII-24' href='#FN_VIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-24]</a> Soon afterward
the project was entertained of detaching Guatemala
from the federation. Neither of the plans led
to the proposed results. The latter was disapproved
by the representative council, and the former was
useless, as the incumbents were continued in office.<a name='FA_VIII-25' id='FA_VIII-25' href='#FN_VIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-25]</a>
This caused the breaking-out of a revolution at La Antigua
in January 1829,<a name='FA_VIII-26' id='FA_VIII-26' href='#FN_VIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-26]</a> which, though easily quelled,
hastened the march of the liberal forces under Morazan
from San Salvador upon Guatemala.<a name='FA_VIII-27' id='FA_VIII-27' href='#FN_VIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-27]</a> After this
leader took the city, on the 13th of April, 1829,
Aycinena and the other chief men of his administration
being thrown into prison, Juan Barrundia was
placed at the head of the government,<a name='FA_VIII-28' id='FA_VIII-28' href='#FN_VIII-28' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-28]</a> and the
authorities of La Antigua were transferred to Guatemala.<a name='FA_VIII-29' id='FA_VIII-29' href='#FN_VIII-29' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-29]</a>
The deposed congress<a name='FA_VIII-30' id='FA_VIII-30' href='#FN_VIII-30' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-30]</a> of 1826 also reassembled
on the 21st of April.<a name='FA_VIII-31' id='FA_VIII-31' href='#FN_VIII-31' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-31]</a> It must be remarked, in
connection with the state's affairs at this time, that,
though nominally in the hands of Barrundia and the
assembly, they were virtually under Morazan's control.
To meet his constant demands for money to
support his forces, a number of financial schemes were
devised, the property of the serviles being almost exclusively
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_153' name='Page_153' href='#Page_153'>153</a></span>
affected by them. Their property, as well as
that under control of the church, was taxed severely.<a name='FA_VIII-32' id='FA_VIII-32' href='#FN_VIII-32' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-32]</a>
Not satisfied with depleting the resources of the
enemy, under the decrees of June 4th and August
22d, the late officials were made amenable to prosecution
in a summary manner, though finally a sort
of ironical amnesty was granted them, involving expatriation,
which was enforced on the 28th of August.<a name='FA_VIII-33' id='FA_VIII-33' href='#FN_VIII-33' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-33]</a>

RULE OF MOLINA AND RIVERA CABEZAS.

<p>
New elections for state authorities resulted in the
choice of Pedro Molina as jefe,<a name='FA_VIII-34' id='FA_VIII-34' href='#FN_VIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-34]</a> and he was inducted
in August 1829. His subsequent disagreement with
the temporary president, José Francisco Barrundia,
the novel ideas he suggested for remodelling the federation,
and the intrigues of his opponents, among
whom has been named the vice-jefe Rivera Cabezas,
brought on his overthrow, when he was superseded on
the 9th of March, 1830, by said vice-jefe.<a name='FA_VIII-35' id='FA_VIII-35' href='#FN_VIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-35]</a>

<p>
During the administration of Rivera Cabezas the
state of Guatemala enjoyed the blessings of peace.
There was only an encounter between the people of
Ilotenango, now Quiché, in Sololá, and those of Chiquimula
in Totonicapan, upon land questions. There
were a few wounded. Rivera Cabezas arranged the
matter to the satisfaction of both towns. He also
accomplished many reforms, ascertained the amount
of the state debt, and introduced a proper economy
in the expenditures.<a name='FA_VIII-36' id='FA_VIII-36' href='#FN_VIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-36]</a>

While internal dissensions were exciting the people
of Guatemala, they were forced to undergo, on the
23d of April, 1830, the tribulations resulting from one
of the severest shocks of earthquake experienced in
the country.<a name='FA_VIII-37' id='FA_VIII-37' href='#FN_VIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-37]</a> Nearly all the inhabitants passed the
night in the streets, public squares, or in the open
fields. The assembly adjourned the following day,
and the state authorities removed to Jocotenango.
Fortunately, no more shocks occurred, and the public
alarm gradually subsided, the damage done being less
than had been supposed.<a name='FA_VIII-38' id='FA_VIII-38' href='#FN_VIII-38' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-38]</a> The clergy made use of

<p class="p2">
After the removal of the national seat of government
to San Salvador, Guatemala found itself in a great
measure freed from the constant bickerings between
the federal and state authorities. The servile party
gained by it; but for all that, the liberal spirit of the
federal administration was still felt. Pursuant to a decree
of the assembly at Jocotenango, elections for state
authorities were made, and José F. Barrundia was the
popular choice for jefe, and Gregorio Marquez for
vice-jefe. Barrundia declined the office, pleading a
previous election as senator. The assembly refused
his resignation, and Barrundia reiterated it, till his
wishes were granted.<a name='FA_VIII-40' id='FA_VIII-40' href='#FN_VIII-40' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-40]</a> The vice-jefe Marquez then
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_155' name='Page_155' href='#Page_155'>155</a></span>
assumed pro tempore the executive office, and retained
as his secretary-general the clergyman of talent, Antonio
Colom. New elections were called for, to be
made by the same electoral bodies which had effected
the last, and Mariano Galvez was chosen jefe, assuming
office in August 1831.<a name='FA_VIII-41' id='FA_VIII-41' href='#FN_VIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-41]</a> This chief of the state

Galvez was not content with encouraging science
and literature; he also directed his efforts to the advancement
of arts and industries, and the improvement

inheritances.<a name='FA_VIII-44' id='FA_VIII-44' href='#FN_VIII-44' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-44]</a> At Galvez' suggestion, the assembly
passed the act of February 27, 1834, to enable nuns
to abandon their convents, if they so desired, taking
the dowries they brought with them. Later, marriage
was declared to be a civil contract that could be

by an English company at Vera Paz, gave rise
to displeasure among the ignorant, which the clergy

erelong became a conflagration.<a name='FA_VIII-46' id='FA_VIII-46' href='#FN_VIII-46' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-46]</a> Added to this was

<p>
The first outbreak occurred in March 1837, when
the Indians of San Juan Ostuncalco rebelled. It was
at once quelled, but the ravages of cholera caused in
June the uprising at Mita. It has been shown in another
place that here, at this juncture, Rafael Carrera
made his first appearance in the political field, inaugurating
the war that eventually dissolved the republic,
and through its consequences brought Guatemala to
the verge of ruin. On the 16th of June, 1837, the assembly
met in extra session, but was unable to effect
any favorable change in the situation. There were
two bitterly opposing parties striving for control. To
make matters worse, insurrections broke out in several
parts,<a name='FA_VIII-48' id='FA_VIII-48' href='#FN_VIII-48' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-48]</a> ending with the capture of the capital by
Carrera on the 31st of January, 1838, and the replacing
of Galvez by Valenzuela on the 2d of February.
That same day the departments of Los Altos,
namely, Sololá, Totonicapan, and Quezaltenango, declared
themselves detached from Guatemala to constitute
the sixth state of the federation, under the name

<p>
The jefe, Molina, was an honest man and an able
jurist. He loved Los Altos, and considered it a
necessary organization for the greater lustre of the
Central American republic; but he had little knowledge
of human nature, and was easily deceived. The
government of Guatemala pursued toward him, since
April 13, 1839, a machiavelian policy, and led him
into the fatal belief that it really desired the prosperity
and happiness of the new state, which had become
the residence of the liberals who had left Guatemala,
fleeing from Carrera,<a name='FA_VIII-53' id='FA_VIII-53' href='#FN_VIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-53]</a> and constantly published severe
strictures against Carrera and the aristocratic clique
which surrounded him. Molina had been persuaded
that the Guatemalan authorities were friendly toward
the state of Los Altos, though requiring that it should
discourage the attacks of the exiled liberals. However,
Molina, abiding by the constitutional clauses
declaring freedom of the press to be inviolable, answered
that the government of Guatemala had the
right of prosecuting the writers before the courts of
Los Altos for libel. This ill feeling was all that Pavon,
the Guatemalan machiavelian minister, desired
for future hostile proceedings. The opportunity was
not wanting, and the state of Los Altos was destroyed
by Carrera on the 29th of January, 1840, and reincorporated
with Guatemala.<a name='FA_VIII-54' id='FA_VIII-54' href='#FN_VIII-54' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-54]</a> Molina, though credulous
and vacillating, at the last moment showed himself
to be possessed of a brave heart. He well knew
that his administration had been a just one, that all
charges against his government, on the part of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>
Guatemala, by Pavon and his fellow-aristocrats, were
false. He did not forsake his post. Carrera grossly
insulted him, and sent him as a prisoner to Guatemala.
General Guzman was reviled, forced to wear rags,
beaten, and his hair and beard pulled out. Other
citizens were shamefully treated, and their homes
plundered.<a name='FA_VIII-55' id='FA_VIII-55' href='#FN_VIII-55' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-55]</a>

RIVERA PAZ AS JEFE.
</p>

<p>
Affairs in Guatemala had undergone a great change
since the removal of Galvez from the position of jefe.
His successor, Valenzuela, was deposed July 22, 1838,
by a popular movement, and Mariano Rivera Paz
placed at the head of affairs.<a name='FA_VIII-56' id='FA_VIII-56' href='#FN_VIII-56' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-56]</a> His first official act
was one deserving of special commendation, as it exhibited
a conciliatory spirit which, unfortunately, had
been a stranger in the country during many years
past. Three days after being installed, at his special
suggestion the state assembly nullified all acts of proscription,
and decreed a general amnesty for all persons
implicated in political offences since September
1821.<a name='FA_VIII-57' id='FA_VIII-57' href='#FN_VIII-57' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-57]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_160' name='Page_160' href='#Page_160'>160</a></span>
</p>

<p>
From the moment Rivera Paz was made the provisional
head of the state government, reaction set in
and went on with flying colors. Measures in consonance
with the wishes of the retrogressionists were
adopted one after another as fast as they could be
drawn up.<a name='FA_VIII-58' id='FA_VIII-58' href='#FN_VIII-58' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-58]</a> These decrees should have satisfied Carrera
and his supporters; but it seems that they did
not; his faction became more and more recalcitrant.
He found himself closely pressed; but, unfortunately,
General Guzman was persuaded to enter into arrangements
with him at El Rinconcito. This, however,
did not bring peace to the state for any length of
time.
</p>

<p>
In the latter part of January 1839 Rivera Paz was
deposed by Cárlos Salazar, military commander of
Guatemala,<a name='FA_VIII-59' id='FA_VIII-59' href='#FN_VIII-59' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-59]</a> but reinstalled by Carrera on the 13th
of April.<a name='FA_VIII-60' id='FA_VIII-60' href='#FN_VIII-60' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-60]</a> This disturbed condition lasted some time
longer. The state declared itself independent on the
17th of April of the same year, and the only form of
union maintained with the other states was by special
treaties of allowance,<a name='FA_VIII-61' id='FA_VIII-61' href='#FN_VIII-61' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-61]</a> in which the states mutually
acknowledged their independence and sovereignty,
and pledged themselves to reconstruct Central America.
All efforts, however, to reëstablish order were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_161' name='Page_161' href='#Page_161'>161</a></span>
in vain, owing to the political complications caused by
Carrera's rebellion in March 1839. His capture of
Guatemala on the 19th of March, 1840, and the end
of the struggle between him and Morazan, which has

affairs; at all events, resolutions subsequently adopted
by the assembly had little weight.<a name='FA_VIII-62' id='FA_VIII-62' href='#FN_VIII-62' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-62]</a> The only important
ones were the restoration of the fuero eclesiástico,<a name='FA_VIII-63' id='FA_VIII-63' href='#FN_VIII-63' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-63]</a>
and the creation of a medical faculty in the
university. Thus, after sixteen years of continual
strife, Guatemala found herself again an independent
and impoverished state. Neither of the parties which
had striven for supremacy had gained anything. The
commonwealth was practically under the dictatorship
of an Indian chieftain, whose will even those who had
helped him to attain his position dared not dispute.

CARRERA'S TRIUMPH.
</p>

<p class="p2">
From the moment that the plan of a Central
American confederation was contemplated, Honduras
manifested her willingness to be one of its members;
and upon the federal constituent assembly fixing, on
the 5th of May, 1824, the basis of organization for
each separate state, a local assembly of eleven deputies
was assigned to Honduras. The state constituent
assembly met at the Mineral de Cedros,<a name='FA_VIII-64' id='FA_VIII-64' href='#FN_VIII-64' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-64]</a> and
on the 16th of September Dionisio Herrera was
chosen jefe del estado, and José Justo Milla vice-jefe.
In July 1825, the territory was divided into seven
departments,<a name='FA_VIII-65' id='FA_VIII-65' href='#FN_VIII-65' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-65]</a> and on the 11th of December the state
constitution was promulgated. This ended the labors
of the constituent body, which four months later was
replaced by the ordinary legislature, the installation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_162' name='Page_162' href='#Page_162'>162</a></span>
of which at Tegucigalpa was followed by that of the
representative council at Comayagua.
</p>

<p>
Honduras was not allowed to enjoy a long term of
peace. The assembly ordered new elections for chief
of state, on the ground that Herrera's tenure of office
had been intended to be merely provisional; but he
held to a different opinion, and refused to surrender
his authority. Matters were made worse by the
enmity existing between Herrera and Irias, the governor
of the diocese.<a name='FA_VIII-66' id='FA_VIII-66' href='#FN_VIII-66' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-66]</a> Anarchy now prevailed,
some of the departments, especially Gracias, refusing
Herrera recognition. This state of things was mainly
instigated by the president of the republic, Arce, who
strove to overthrow the liberal party in Honduras.
Under the pretence that Santa Rosa, in the department
of Gracias, out of which the federal government
drew a revenue from tobacco, needed protection, Arce
despatched there 200 men under Milla, the vice-jefe,<a name='FA_VIII-67' id='FA_VIII-67' href='#FN_VIII-67' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-67]</a>
who, after a short encounter with Herrera's force,
marched upon Comayagua,<a name='FA_VIII-68' id='FA_VIII-68' href='#FN_VIII-68' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-68]</a> arriving there early in
April 1827. The town had been hastily fortified,
and energetically resisted thirty-six days; but not
receiving timely reënforcements, succumbed on the
9th of May, 1827.<a name='FA_VIII-69' id='FA_VIII-69' href='#FN_VIII-69' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-69]</a> Herrera was sent as a prisoner to
Guatemala, and new elections were ordered in Honduras.<a name='FA_VIII-70' id='FA_VIII-70' href='#FN_VIII-70' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-70]</a>
A new legislature on the 13th of September
chose Gerónimo Zelaya jefe, but he was recognized as
such only in Santa Bárbara. All liberals were dismissed
from office. Francisco Morazan, who had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'>163</a></span>
been imprisoned, notwithstanding the safe-conduct
given him after the fall of Comayagua, managed to
escape, and subsequently rendered efficient aid to
defeat the federals at Trinidad.<a name='FA_VIII-71' id='FA_VIII-71' href='#FN_VIII-71' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-71]</a> The government
installed by Milla disappeared, Morazan temporarily
assuming the reins in November. The further interference
of the federal government in the internal
affairs of Honduras has been fully narrated elsewhere.
The country was not exempt from internal
troubles from the close of 1829<a name='FA_VIII-72' id='FA_VIII-72' href='#FN_VIII-72' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-72]</a> to the beginning of
1833, requiring nearly always the final intervention

LIBERAL IDEAS IN HONDURAS.

<p>
Morazan's ascendency awakened in Honduras more
liberal ideas than had ever prevailed in the country,
as was evidenced in the laws then enacted.<a name='FA_VIII-74' id='FA_VIII-74' href='#FN_VIII-74' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-74]</a> During
the following years Honduras was comparatively tranquil,
the political agitations of the republic scarcely
affecting her. There was a local sedition in December
1836, and the early part of 1837, contributing
to render much worse the financial condition of the
state, which had been bad enough before.<a name='FA_VIII-75' id='FA_VIII-75' href='#FN_VIII-75' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-75]</a> The
friends of the federation decreased from day to day.
Honduras accepted the act of the federal congress
authorizing the states to constitute themselves as they
liked; and in June 1838 the legislature and executive
called for a constituent assembly to do so, which
met at Comayagua on the 7th of October.<a name='FA_VIII-76' id='FA_VIII-76' href='#FN_VIII-76' class='fnanchor'>[VIII-76]</a>

Salvador, from the earliest days that utterance was
given to the idea of liberty and independence from
Spain, was ready to echo and champion it, and was
the first to effect an organization for self-government.<a name='FA_IX-1' id='FA_IX-1' href='#FN_IX-1' class='fnanchor'>[IX-1]</a>
The state was divided into four departments,
San Salvador, San Vicente, San Miguel, and Sonsonate.<a name='FA_IX-2' id='FA_IX-2' href='#FN_IX-2' class='fnanchor'>[IX-2]</a>
Under the direction of the constituent assembly

vice-jefe. After installing a superior court, the constituent
assembly adjourned sine die on the 23d of
November, 1824.
</p>

<p>
For a long time past there had been differences
between Guatemala and Salvador upon ecclesiastical
matters. The latter not only claimed an authoritative
voice in the political affairs of Central America,
but also to be placed upon an independent footing as
regarded the ecclesiastical. Hence the anxiety to
have a bishopric erected at San Salvador. This matter
assumed a threatening aspect, and engaged the
attention of ecclesiastics and statesmen, as well as the
public at large in both sections of the country. The
details will be given in a separate chapter treating of
the church in Central America. It is in order to
state here, however, that the disputes about the
diocese of San Salvador had a deep influence in the
country's politics. The contending parties had taken
up the question. The liberals in both states sided
with José Matías Delgado, who had been appointed
by the Salvador legislature the first bishop. The servile
element, on the other hand, supported the archbishop
of Guatemala. But after a time Delgado,
who was not unmindful of his purposes, supported
President Arce, thus forsaking his former friends, and
joining the servile party. A marked change occurred
soon after, however, the relations between Arce and
Delgado becoming cold because the latter suspected
that Arce really sympathized with the archbishop.
The liberals failed not to strengthen that suspicion, nor
to fan the flame.<a name='FA_IX-4' id='FA_IX-4' href='#FN_IX-4' class='fnanchor'>[IX-4]</a>
</p>

<p>
Jefe Villacorta, owing to impaired health, surrendered
the government to the vice-jefe, Mariano
Prado,<a name='FA_IX-5' id='FA_IX-5' href='#FN_IX-5' class='fnanchor'>[IX-5]</a> whose first act was one of opposition to the
national government, by repealing Arce's convocation
of October 10th for a new congress, and issuing one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
of his own, on December 6, 1826, appointing Ahuachapan,
in Salvador, as the place of assemblage.
Prado now began the military preparations which
were followed by a war between Salvador and the
federal government, and which terminated with the
overthrow of the servile party by Morazan.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
RULE OF CORNEJO AND PRADO.
</p>

<p>
A liberal policy was for a short time pursued in
Salvador under the rule of José M. Cornejo, who had
become the jefe in January 1829,<a name='FA_IX-6' id='FA_IX-6' href='#FN_IX-6' class='fnanchor'>[IX-6]</a> and peace reigned
during the next three years. But in 1832 it was
again disturbed. The government of the state, becoming
dissatisfied with its former hero, Morazan,
attempted to secede from the union, but was brought
under subjection.<a name='FA_IX-7' id='FA_IX-7' href='#FN_IX-7' class='fnanchor'>[IX-7]</a> Cornejo was deposed, and, together
with those who aided him in the rebellion, was sent
to Guatemala as a prisoner, to be dealt with according
to law.<a name='FA_IX-8' id='FA_IX-8' href='#FN_IX-8' class='fnanchor'>[IX-8]</a> Elections for authorities were then held,
and Mariano Prado was chosen jefe,<a name='FA_IX-9' id='FA_IX-9' href='#FN_IX-9' class='fnanchor'>[IX-9]</a> and Joaquin San
Martin y Ulloa vice-jefe. A period of liberalism now
commenced, like that of Guatemala in 1829. Several
liberal measures were adopted, one of which was the
establishment—decreed August 21, 1832—of a single,
very moderate, direct tax.<a name='FA_IX-10' id='FA_IX-10' href='#FN_IX-10' class='fnanchor'>[IX-10]</a> This enactment,
intended to relieve the exhausted treasury, met with
violent opposition in San Salvador, and sedition broke
out on the 24th in several wards; but the rioters were
dispersed. Prado issued a proclamation expressing
his resolution to uphold the law and maintain order;
but as the excitement continued, he ordered that the
supreme authorities should transfer themselves to
the villa de Cojetepeque on the 31st.<a name='FA_IX-11' id='FA_IX-11' href='#FN_IX-11' class='fnanchor'>[IX-11]</a> On the 14th
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
of November there was also a seditious movement in
San Miguel, which was quelled by Colonel Benitez.
</p>

<p>
The vice-jefe, San Martin, was in accord with the
revolutionists, and kept up a correspondence with
Galvez in Guatemala, who wanted Prado overthrown.
This was known in San Salvador, and gave encouragement
to the remnants of Cornejo's party. The removal
of the capital was not sufficient. Another revolt
broke out at San Salvador early in 1833, and Prado,
together with the members of the co-legislative bodies
and of the superior court, had to abandon their places.
On the 13th of February the state followed the example
of Nicaragua and seceded from the union. The
vice-jefe, San Martin, who had gone into hiding on
the 9th of February to save himself from harm, was
called by the revolutionists to assume the executive
authority.<a name='FA_IX-12' id='FA_IX-12' href='#FN_IX-12' class='fnanchor'>[IX-12]</a> In July a revolt broke out among the
Indians of Santiago Nonualco. Headed by Anastasio
Aquino, they formed the plan of exterminating
the white and colored population, and installing a government
of natives.<a name='FA_IX-13' id='FA_IX-13' href='#FN_IX-13' class='fnanchor'>[IX-13]</a> The utmost cruelties characterized
this war of races, which was fortunately soon
suppressed. Most of the ringleaders, among them
Aquino, were captured. The chief was executed on
the 24th of July, 1833, at San Vicente.<a name='FA_IX-14' id='FA_IX-14' href='#FN_IX-14' class='fnanchor'>[IX-14]</a> But peace
did not follow the suppression of this rebellion. Salvador,
always jealous of Guatemala, insisted on having
the federal government removed from her rival's
territory. At last, in February 1834, the federal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
authorities came to reside in Sonsonate, and later, in
June, at San Salvador. It was a great mistake to
expect harmony. Before the month was out there
was a street fight of several hours between troops of
the two powers. The federals were victorious, and
the state's jefe, San Martin, was deposed.<a name='FA_IX-15' id='FA_IX-15' href='#FN_IX-15' class='fnanchor'>[IX-15]</a> The executive
authority was assumed first by Cárlos Salazar,
commander of the federal forces, and afterward
by Gregorio Salazar, the vice-president of the republic.
Neither of them had a legal title.<a name='FA_IX-16' id='FA_IX-16' href='#FN_IX-16' class='fnanchor'>[IX-16]</a> From this
time the state remained wholly under the control of
the federal government and the liberal party, which
became still more cemented when in 1835 the capital
was made the federal district. In the great struggle
between Morazan and Carrera, of which a detailed
account has been given in a former chapter, Salvador
had to rely entirely on her own resources when her
territory was invaded in 1838 and 1839.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
MORE TROUBLE AT SAN SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
After Morazan's signal defeat at Guatemala, Salvador
no longer was disposed to make sacrifices; indeed,
she was too exhausted to raise a new army. However,
she was by no means willing to uphold the victorious
Carrera; but being unable to resist, had for a while
to submit to the force of circumstances, and to recognize
the government placed over her.<a name='FA_IX-17' id='FA_IX-17' href='#FN_IX-17' class='fnanchor'>[IX-17]</a> But as soon
as Carrera went back to Guatemala, that government
was overthrown by the people, and the jefe, José
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
Antonio Cañas, had to resign,<a name='FA_IX-18' id='FA_IX-18' href='#FN_IX-18' class='fnanchor'>[IX-18]</a> Norberto Ramirez
becoming the jefe provisional.<a name='FA_IX-19' id='FA_IX-19' href='#FN_IX-19' class='fnanchor'>[IX-19]</a> More than any other
of the Central American states, Salvador needed a
period of peace to recover from the wounds inflicted
in nearly twenty years of warfare. She had upheld
the principles of liberty and union long after the others
had given them up, and now required a prudent and
wise government to restore her almost extinct life and
strength.
</p>

<p class="p2">
While the other provinces experienced but few difficulties
in organizing themselves after the separation
from Spain and Mexico, Nicaragua suffered for years
from intestine strife. This was not exactly a contest
between two political parties, but rather between
towns, and between the partisans of one leader and
another; in other words, the results partly of sectional
hatred, and partly of personal ambition. Persecutions
for political causes were of daily occurrence.<a name='FA_IX-20' id='FA_IX-20' href='#FN_IX-20' class='fnanchor'>[IX-20]</a>
A junta gubernativa, recognized by the general government,
had been installed at Leon,<a name='FA_IX-21' id='FA_IX-21' href='#FN_IX-21' class='fnanchor'>[IX-21]</a> where Basilio
Carrillo was the commander of the forces, and claimed
the right to rule the province; but there was another
junta at Granada, where the notorious Cleto Ordoñez
held sway in accord with the jefe político, Juan Argüello,
which, of course, ignored the pretensions of
the Leonese authorities. Managua, though siding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_171' name='Page_171' href='#Page_171'>171</a></span>
with Leon, had become the headquarters of the anti-republicans,
with Bishop García at their head, who
strove to rid the place from Leonese influence. Most
of the other towns were in a similar condition; so that
it may be asserted that the whole province was in a
state of anarchy. The junta gubernativa of Leon
accepted, on the 2d of July, 1823, the decree of the
national government of March 29th, calling for a
national congress, and declared Nicaragua united with
the other provinces that had formerly been the reino
de Guatemala.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
NICARAGUAN COMPLICATIONS.
</p>

<p>
On the 13th of January, 1824, a popular uprising
in Leon caused the junta gubernativa to remove Basilio
Carrillo from his command, replacing him with
the jefe político, Cármen Salazar.<a name='FA_IX-22' id='FA_IX-22' href='#FN_IX-22' class='fnanchor'>[IX-22]</a> Early in the same
year Justo Milla came with the appointment of intendente
from the general government, and with instructions
to pacify the country; but his mission failed.<a name='FA_IX-23' id='FA_IX-23' href='#FN_IX-23' class='fnanchor'>[IX-23]</a>
On the 22d of July Ordoñez had himself proclaimed
comandante general by the garrison and populace.
Some of the wards of Leon attempted, on the 6th of
August, to overthrow Ordoñez and restore Melendez,
the successor of Milla; but they were overpowered,
and the city was sacked.<a name='FA_IX-24' id='FA_IX-24' href='#FN_IX-24' class='fnanchor'>[IX-24]</a> On the 14th the forces of
Managua, under Colonel Crisanto Sacasa, captured
portions of the city of Granada. After twenty days
of incessant fighting the besiegers retired in good
order. On the other hand, a division of Leonese and
Granadans attacked Managua on the 24th of August,
with the same result.
</p>

<p>
A junta gubernativa had been installed on the 9th
of the month at El Viejo, in opposition to that of the
capital,<a name='FA_IX-25' id='FA_IX-25' href='#FN_IX-25' class='fnanchor'>[IX-25]</a> and organized a force of 2,000 men, intended
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_172' name='Page_172' href='#Page_172'>172</a></span>
to lay siege to Leon. The united forces of El Viejo
and Managua, commanded by Sacasa and the Colombian
Juan José Salas, assaulted Leon, captured the
suburbs, and penetrated to the plazuela de San Juan.
The garrison, composed of Leonese and some Granadans,
now found itself confined to the chief plaza and
contiguous blocks. During the siege, which lasted
114 days, there was incessant fighting, both besiegers
and besieged exhibiting bitter animosity. Sacasa was
mortally wounded, and died twelve days after. The
fighting often took place inside of the houses, and even
of the churches. Upwards of 900 houses were either
demolished or burned, and the number of dead and
wounded on both sides was large, probably over 900
killed. The contest ceased only on the 4th of January,
1825, when the besieging forces retired.<a name='FA_IX-26' id='FA_IX-26' href='#FN_IX-26' class='fnanchor'>[IX-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
The villa de Managua laid down its arms on the
22d of January, 1825, peaceably receiving Manuel
José Arce, who had entered Nicaragua with an auxiliary
force from Salvador, and with instructions to
pacify the state. In consequence of his arrival, the
dissensions were quieted for a time.<a name='FA_IX-27' id='FA_IX-27' href='#FN_IX-27' class='fnanchor'>[IX-27]</a> Arce, without
bloodshed, also disarmed the troops of Ordoñez at
Granada, and despatched him, together with Bishop
García, to Guatemala. After having made arrangements
for elections, the peace-maker returned to Salvador,
leaving, however, a portion of the force at
Leon.

<p class="sidenote">
RULE OF ARGÜELLO.
</p>

<p>
On the 10th of April, 1825, preliminary arrangements
being completed, the first constituent assembly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_173' name='Page_173' href='#Page_173'>173</a></span>
of Nicaragua met under the presidency of Juan Manuel
Zamora, and ten days later Manuel Antonio de
la Cerda was installed as jefe of the state,<a name='FA_IX-28' id='FA_IX-28' href='#FN_IX-28' class='fnanchor'>[IX-28]</a> and Juan
Argüello as vice-jefe. Unfortunately there were disagreements
on the part of Cerda with both the constituent
assembly and Argüello, which delayed the
labors on the state constitution, so that it was not
decreed till the 8th of April, 1826.<a name='FA_IX-29' id='FA_IX-29' href='#FN_IX-29' class='fnanchor'>[IX-29]</a>
</p>

<p>
The convention then adjourned sine die, and the regular
or ordinary assembly met on the 13th of August,
at Leon, but in the middle of the following month
removed to Granada.<a name='FA_IX-30' id='FA_IX-30' href='#FN_IX-30' class='fnanchor'>[IX-30]</a> Meantime the dissatisfaction
with Jefe Cerda had assumed such proportions that
the legislative body resolved to impeach him. He
was, accordingly, suspended, and Argüello placed
temporarily in charge of the executive authority.
New elections were also decreed.<a name='FA_IX-31' id='FA_IX-31' href='#FN_IX-31' class='fnanchor'>[IX-31]</a> But Argüello had
not fostered all these troubles merely to surrender the
government to a new man, and by intrigues contrived
to bring about, in February 1827, the dissolution of
the assembly.<a name='FA_IX-32' id='FA_IX-32' href='#FN_IX-32' class='fnanchor'>[IX-32]</a>
</p>

<p>
The indefatigable Colonel Cleto Ordoñez made,
with the aid of troops of Leon and Senator Hernandez,
an unsuccessful attempt<a name='FA_IX-33' id='FA_IX-33' href='#FN_IX-33' class='fnanchor'>[IX-33]</a> to seize the government,
declaring Argüello suspended. An effort was also
made by the president on behalf of Cerda, but it was
defeated by Herrera, the jefe of Honduras. The
state of war continued; Arce reluctantly had removed,
at Argüello's request, the few men of Salvador that
had been stationed in Nicaragua since 1825,<a name='FA_IX-34' id='FA_IX-34' href='#FN_IX-34' class='fnanchor'>[IX-34]</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
thus the only adversary of importance Argüello had
was Cerda. The contest remained for a long time
undecided. Argüello took Granada, while Cerda's
headquarters were first at Managua, and, when that
place seceded, at Rivas, the ancient town of Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
In September 1828, Cerda's party had made so
much headway that Argüello and his followers had
vessels in readiness to effect their escape should the
jefe gain another victory. But the priests, who
worked against the latter, inspired the disheartened
Argüellistas with renewed courage, and in another
encounter they were victorious. Cerda's star now
waned. A revolt planned by two of his officers was
quelled, and the leaders were shot.<a name='FA_IX-35' id='FA_IX-35' href='#FN_IX-35' class='fnanchor'>[IX-35]</a> This severity,
and the heavy taxes he levied, increased his foes.<a name='FA_IX-36' id='FA_IX-36' href='#FN_IX-36' class='fnanchor'>[IX-36]</a>
At last, on the 8th of November, 1828, when Rivas
was almost without troops, one of his officers, who
was a relative, named Francisco Argüello, made him
a prisoner, and before his troops could come from
Jinotepe to his rescue, a force of the vice-jefe entered
Rivas. A military court was at once organized,
and Cerda, being subjected to its action,<a name='FA_IX-37' id='FA_IX-37' href='#FN_IX-37' class='fnanchor'>[IX-37]</a> was sentenced
to death, and executed.<a name='FA_IX-38' id='FA_IX-38' href='#FN_IX-38' class='fnanchor'>[IX-38]</a>

HERRERA'S RULE.
</p>

<p>
Argüello was now free from his strongest adversary;
but the struggle went on as new pretenders
sprang up, and its effects in the course of time were
most disastrous. It brought the state to a condition
of desolation unequalled in Central America. Dionisio
Herrera, chief of Honduras, undertook, under
instructions of the federal government, in 1829, the

and succeeded in conciliating parties and restoring

order; and when new elections took place in May
1830 he was himself chosen its jefe.<a name='FA_IX-39' id='FA_IX-39' href='#FN_IX-39' class='fnanchor'>[IX-39]</a> Managua, the
last place to hold out, was finally, without the use of
force, prevailed upon to recognize the newly constituted
authorities, and in June was already enjoying
the benefits of peace. In order to consolidate the peace
throughout the state, Herrera made the leaders of
parties leave its territory. His rule was a quiet one
for the next two years, and until Nicaragua was called
upon by the national government to furnish her contingent
of troops to suppress revolutionary movements
beyond her boundary.<a name='FA_IX-40' id='FA_IX-40' href='#FN_IX-40' class='fnanchor'>[IX-40]</a>
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary spirit showed itself again in 1832.
On December 3, 1832, the state assembly attached
the federal revenue, and refused further recognition
of the general government. A few months later a
revolt broke out against Herrera. The movement
originated in Managua, and was seconded in Masaya
and Matagalpa. Granada and Leon opposed it.
Jefe Herrera at first was loath to resist it, and laid
his resignation before the legislature, and it was accepted
on the 1st of March, 1833. But that body,
under popular pressure, four days after revoked the
resolution, and recalled Herrera to hold the executive
authority, with the extraordinary powers that had
been decreed him on the 8th of February previous.<a name='FA_IX-41' id='FA_IX-41' href='#FN_IX-41' class='fnanchor'>[IX-41]</a>
</p>

<p>
The insurrection had spread also in Metapa, Chocoyos,
Nandaime, San Jorge, and throughout the department
of Nicaragua. At the head of the movement
was an ecclesiastic. Herrera exhausted all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
peaceful means, and had to employ force, and Managua
was taken on the 29th of June, 1833.<a name='FA_IX-42' id='FA_IX-42' href='#FN_IX-42' class='fnanchor'>[IX-42]</a> Nicaragua
and other places accepted the amnesty tendered
them.<a name='FA_IX-43' id='FA_IX-43' href='#FN_IX-43' class='fnanchor'>[IX-43]</a> But it seemed almost impossible to maintain
peace for any length of time. In May 1834 Granada
and Metapa rebelled, under one Cándido Flores. The
rebels were successful for several months, and took
possession of Managua. But on the 13th of August
they were defeated; a few days later Granada was
recovered, and four of the ringleaders were shot.

A GREAT EARTHQUAKE.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In the morning of the 20th of January, 1835, there
was an eruption of the volcano Cosigüina,<a name='FA_IX-44' id='FA_IX-44' href='#FN_IX-44' class='fnanchor'>[IX-44]</a> attended
by one of the most terrific earthquakes ever experienced

one for the Nicaraguans, and its abatement was
attributed to the efficacious intercession of their saints;
and in commemoration of it they still have a feast of
thanksgiving every year on the 23d of January.<a name='FA_IX-46' id='FA_IX-46' href='#FN_IX-46' class='fnanchor'>[IX-46]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
A short period of peace followed. Puny are the
efforts of man at killing each other when heaven fires
its artillery! The exhausted state seemed unable to
continue its suicidal course. The tranquillity was
broken, however, though only for a short time, in
1837.<a name='FA_IX-47' id='FA_IX-47' href='#FN_IX-47' class='fnanchor'>[IX-47]</a> The assembly had, on the 21st of February,
1835, recognized José Zepeda and José Nuñez as the
duly elected jefe and vice-jefe respectively. Colonel
Zepeda was a distinguished patriot, who had rendered
important services to the cause of liberty. His election
was hailed with approval in Nicaragua, and in
the other states of the union. He took possession of
office April 23, 1835.<a name='FA_IX-48' id='FA_IX-48' href='#FN_IX-48' class='fnanchor'>[IX-48]</a> The government experienced
no serious difficulty during 1836 in the administration
of public affairs. It was engaged in improving the
public roads, and in other matters of general utility.
But 1837 was inaugurated with infamous crimes, with
the murders of the jefe Zepeda, and of the citizens
Roman Valladares, Evaristo Berríos, and Pascual
Rivas, which resulted from a revolt of the garrison at
Leon.<a name='FA_IX-49' id='FA_IX-49' href='#FN_IX-49' class='fnanchor'>[IX-49]</a> The movement was promptly suppressed,
and the ringleader, Braulio Mendiola, executed. The
vice-jefe, Nuñez, assumed rulership, and during his
administration a second constituent assembly was convened,
and commenced its labors on the 31st of March,

1838.<a name='FA_IX-50' id='FA_IX-50' href='#FN_IX-50' class='fnanchor'>[IX-50]</a> One month later, on the 30th of April, the
state seceded from the federation, an act which may
be called a mere formality, inasmuch as Nicaragua
had not taken part, to any notable degree, in the
affairs of the general government. Nominally, however,
the idea of a union of the Central American
states was upheld, and still expressed in the new state
constitution framed by the assembly and confirmed on
the 12th of November, 1838.<a name='FA_IX-51' id='FA_IX-51' href='#FN_IX-51' class='fnanchor'>[IX-51]</a> All this was pure affectation,
however, for Nicaragua lent her hearty aid
to eradicate the last remnants of the federation. The
coveted sovereignty was attained at last. Later events
will show whether or not it brought Nicaragua prosperity.
The present generation had grown up midst
the noise of war, hearing the battle-cry of one or another
contending party, and it could hardly be expected
that it could appreciate the blessings of peace.<a name='FA_IX-52' id='FA_IX-52' href='#FN_IX-52' class='fnanchor'>[IX-52]</a>

EVENTS IN COSTA RICA.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Costa Rica, owing to her geographical position, was
almost isolated, politically, from the rest of Central
America. It would be wrong, however, to infer that
her participation in the general affairs of the republic
had been one of mere formality or policy for her own
convenience or safety. Nowhere had the idea of a union
been more warmly embraced. Four months only had
elapsed after the bases for the organization of the
state had been adopted by the national constituent
convention, when Costa Rica's first assembly met,<a name='FA_IX-53' id='FA_IX-53' href='#FN_IX-53' class='fnanchor'>[IX-53]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'>179</a></span>
and on the 21st of January, 1825, decreed a state
constitution.<a name='FA_IX-54' id='FA_IX-54' href='#FN_IX-54' class='fnanchor'>[IX-54]</a> In the middle of April the first ordinary
legislature began its labors, and on the 24th of
September Juan Mora was installed as chief of the
state.<a name='FA_IX-55' id='FA_IX-55' href='#FN_IX-55' class='fnanchor'>[IX-55]</a> This was a happy choice; for during his rule
Costa Rica escaped the evils which protracted warfare
wrought in the other states of the union. Following
the example of Salvador, a decree was passed
in September creating a bishopric independent from
Nicaragua, and appointing Fray Luis García the first
bishop; but the decree became a dead letter.
</p>

<p>
The first effect of Mora's quiet rule was the enlargement
of Costa Rican territory. Dissatisfied with
the jefe, Cerda of Nicaragua, the district of Guanacaste,
or Nicoya, which formerly belonged to that
state, declared its separation, and asked to be incorporated
with Costa Rica.<a name='FA_IX-56' id='FA_IX-56' href='#FN_IX-56' class='fnanchor'>[IX-56]</a> The arrangement was approved
by the federal congress on December 9th, and
since then Nicoya formed one of the five departments
of that state.<a name='FA_IX-57' id='FA_IX-57' href='#FN_IX-57' class='fnanchor'>[IX-57]</a> Nicaragua protested; Costa Rica refused
to restore the territory, and the matter remained
an open subject of discussion, but never leading to
hostilities.<a name='FA_IX-58' id='FA_IX-58' href='#FN_IX-58' class='fnanchor'>[IX-58]</a>
</p>

<p>
Early in 1826 an attempt was made<a name='FA_IX-59' id='FA_IX-59' href='#FN_IX-59' class='fnanchor'>[IX-59]</a> by a Spaniard
named José Zamora, at Alajuela, to overthrow the
government. He attacked the quarters of the garrison,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_180' name='Page_180' href='#Page_180'>180</a></span>
but after several hours' fighting was repulsed,
with most of his followers slain, wounded, or made
prisoners. A few days afterward he was captured and
shot.<a name='FA_IX-60' id='FA_IX-60' href='#FN_IX-60' class='fnanchor'>[IX-60]</a> During several years this was the only public
disturbance. The struggle between serviles and liberals
in the other states did not affect Costa Rica, which
prudently maintained neutrality. She endeavored,
however, to bring on peace between the belligerents,
by accrediting, in 1828, Manuel Aguilar as special
envoy to Guatemala and Salvador; but his mission
proved fruitless, chiefly owing to the success of the
Salvador arms, and the irreconcilable feeling thereby
engendered.<a name='FA_IX-61' id='FA_IX-61' href='#FN_IX-61' class='fnanchor'>[IX-61]</a> It was the unsatisfactory result of this
effort, which in a great measure prompted Costa
Rica, after Mora's reëlection in 1829, to secede from
the union till the federal authority should be reorganized.
When this took place, the secession act was
revoked in January 1831.
</p>

<p>
In March 1833 the second term of office of Mora
expired; and in acknowledgment of his beneficent and
wise policy, the assembly decreed that his portrait
should be placed in the hall of sessions, with a highly
complimentary inscription.<a name='FA_IX-62' id='FA_IX-62' href='#FN_IX-62' class='fnanchor'>[IX-62]</a> Costa Rica had made
great progress from both the material and intellectual
points of view. A number of clergymen endeavored
to introduce a decree of the ecclesiastical authorities of
Guatemala to burn certain so-called forbidden books.
They failed, the result being the importation of a large
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_181' name='Page_181' href='#Page_181'>181</a></span>
number of the denounced works. Jefe Mora treated
the pious proposal with the contempt it deserved.<a name='FA_IX-63' id='FA_IX-63' href='#FN_IX-63' class='fnanchor'>[IX-63]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
RULE OF GALLEGOS AND CARRILLO.
</p>

<p>
Mora's successor duly elected was José Rafael Gallegos,
who assumed his duties in April 1833.<a name='FA_IX-64' id='FA_IX-64' href='#FN_IX-64' class='fnanchor'>[IX-64]</a> The
state at this time was enjoying liberty, and perfect
freedom of the press.<a name='FA_IX-65' id='FA_IX-65' href='#FN_IX-65' class='fnanchor'>[IX-65]</a> It was the asylum of the
exiles from other Central and South American states.
It was not, however, altogether exempt from the
spirit of localism. Cartago had been the capital, and
wanted to recover that position. San José felt as a
loss the absence of the supreme authorities. Heredia
and Alajuela would not be less than the other two
places. Guanacaste was the only one out of the
question. Hence the resolution adopted<a name='FA_IX-66' id='FA_IX-66' href='#FN_IX-66' class='fnanchor'>[IX-66]</a> that the
state capital should alternately be at San José, Cartago,
Heredia, and Alajuela. A later law, of June
9th, prescribed that the residence of the supreme
authorities at each of said places should be for the
period of four years. Gallegos' rule was of short
duration. He resigned in March 1834.<a name='FA_IX-67' id='FA_IX-67' href='#FN_IX-67' class='fnanchor'>[IX-67]</a>
</p>

<p>
Braulio Carrillo was elected jefe, and went into
office in April 1835.<a name='FA_IX-68' id='FA_IX-68' href='#FN_IX-68' class='fnanchor'>[IX-68]</a> In his time several liberal
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>

some time previously; namely, suppression of
tithes and decrease of holidays;<a name='FA_IX-69' id='FA_IX-69' href='#FN_IX-69' class='fnanchor'>[IX-69]</a> those enactments
aroused the clergy, and prompted them to fan, in
retaliation, the flame of discord existing between San
José and Cartago, which culminated in an open revolt
on the 24th of September, 1835.
</p>

<p>
An alliance was entered into by Cartago with Alajuela
and Heredia, to refuse recognition to the government,
and to convoke a new assembly with equal
representative rights for the different towns.<a name='FA_IX-70' id='FA_IX-70' href='#FN_IX-70' class='fnanchor'>[IX-70]</a> The
allied forces marched upon San José, then the seat of
government; but were defeated in several encounters,
and they again submitted.<a name='FA_IX-71' id='FA_IX-71' href='#FN_IX-71' class='fnanchor'>[IX-71]</a> The result of this revolt
was the further strengthening of San José, to which
place was conveyed all the armament of the state.
The government was equally successful in the following
year, when an armed force from Nicaragua, led by
the Costa Rican Manuel Quijano, formerly in his
country's military service, Pedro Abellan, and Manuel
Dengo, entered the department of Guanacaste,
and marched upon its chief town, where they expected
to find support; but they only met with disappointment.
They were first repulsed by the inhabitants,
and afterward routed by the troops.<a name='FA_IX-72' id='FA_IX-72' href='#FN_IX-72' class='fnanchor'>[IX-72]</a>

REVOLT IN COSTA RICA.

The peace thus restored was not of long duration.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_183' name='Page_183' href='#Page_183'>183</a></span>
by Manuel Aguilar, in April 1837. A plot intended
to overthrow the government was soon after detected,
and the authors were sent into exile.<a name='FA_IX-74' id='FA_IX-74' href='#FN_IX-74' class='fnanchor'>[IX-74]</a> But Carrillo
had also been disappointed at Aguilar's election, and
being influential with the soldiery, he had but little
difficulty in getting together a party with which, on
the 27th of May, 1838, he deposed this official, sending
him, together with the vice-jefe, Juan Mora, into
banishment.<a name='FA_IX-75' id='FA_IX-75' href='#FN_IX-75' class='fnanchor'>[IX-75]</a> This was the first instance in Costa
Rica when the legitimate government of the state
was overthrown by force of arms. It cannot be said
that the change was altogether for the worse. Under
Carrillo's active and energetic rule the country made
rapid progress in a material point of view.<a name='FA_IX-76' id='FA_IX-76' href='#FN_IX-76' class='fnanchor'>[IX-76]</a> He saw
at once the hopelessness of reëstablishing the Central

to render it beneficent to the several states; and
therefore, instead of making fruitless efforts in that
direction, strove rather to isolate Costa Rica. This
policy he impressed on the second constituent convention,
which met on the 1st of November, 1838,<a name='FA_IX-78' id='FA_IX-78' href='#FN_IX-78' class='fnanchor'>[IX-78]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>

He also took effective steps to pay off Costa Rica's

American republic. The state was for a long time
exempted from the afflictions and consequent injurious
results which visited the other states during the bitter
last struggle in 1840 between Morazan and Carrera

were impoverished and brought to the verge of ruin,

<p class="sidenote">ENGLISH INTERVENTION.
</p>

<p>
The government of Nicaragua, on the 13th of
September, 1839, following the advice of Minister
Pavon of Guatemala, asked for the mediation of
Frederick Chatfield, the British consul, in an endeavor
to bring to an end the existing dissensions
with Salvador. Chatfield declined to interfere, on the
plea that Salvador, in a treaty with the state of Los
Altos, on the 10th of August, had insulted the British
crown.<a name='FA_X-1' id='FA_X-1' href='#FN_X-1' class='fnanchor'>[X-1]</a> However, on the 27th of May, 1840, he
sent to the government of Nicaragua an extract of a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_187' name='Page_187' href='#Page_187'>187</a></span>
despatch of March 2d from the British foreign office,
saying that his sovereign would cordially mediate between
the two states, provided such mediation was
asked for by both, or by all the governments interested,
in which event he, Chatfield, was authorized to
use his good offices. But he was at the same time
directed to add that Great Britain was not disposed
to enter into any engagement binding her to employ
armed forces in Central America. This course was
not pleasing to Pavon, but fully satisfied the executive
of Nicaragua. Chatfield's mediation was never
called for.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Buitrago, director of the state of Nicaragua, was
drawn by the force of public opinion to give his assent
to the state taking part in a convention intended
to reorganize the republic of Central America.<a name='FA_X-2' id='FA_X-2' href='#FN_X-2' class='fnanchor'>[X-2]</a> The

the accomplishment of their mission; but from the

disgust left the convention after filing a protest.<a name='FA_X-3' id='FA_X-3' href='#FN_X-3' class='fnanchor'>[X-3]</a>
They returned to it afterward, however, and on the
11th of April, 1842, the convention made a declaration
in seven articles establishing a 'gobierno nacional
provisorio,' having at its head a 'supremo
delegado,' with a council composed of one representative
chosen by each of the respective state assemblies.<a name='FA_X-4' id='FA_X-4' href='#FN_X-4' class='fnanchor'>[X-4]</a>
Antonio José Cañas was appointed supremo
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
delegado. But this great effort on the part of the
men imbued with a truly patriotic spirit came to
naught, because the assembly of Guatemala indignantly
rejected the compact of Chinandega, and Ferrera
of Honduras acted in bad faith. Costa Rica
accepted it with certain restrictions.<a name='FA_X-5' id='FA_X-5' href='#FN_X-5' class='fnanchor'>[X-5]</a>

A second effort was made on the 27th of July at

Sixteen of the articles in the constitution conformed
with the instructions given by the aristocrats of Guatemala
through the state assembly to the commissioners
despatched to the villa de Santa Rosa on the 28th
of September, 1839; and yet, after their adoption by
the convention of Chinandega, these same persons
made opposition to them. The fact was, that they
had been all along using deception, appointing commissioners
to several diets, but never intending that
a reorganization of Central American nationality
should be arrived at.<a name='FA_X-7' id='FA_X-7' href='#FN_X-7' class='fnanchor'>[X-7]</a>

PACTO DE CHINANDEGA.
</p>

<p>
Guatemala accredited a legation at Leon, Gerónimo
Carcache being the envoy. He tried to exculpate
his government for its opposition to the compact of
Chinandega, asserting at the same time its firm resolve
to uphold the treaty concluded in October 1842,
by Pavon, Arriaga, and Duran, and accepted by
Costa Rica in May 1843.<a name='FA_X-8' id='FA_X-8' href='#FN_X-8' class='fnanchor'>[X-8]</a> This opposition, notwithstanding
the organization of the executive and council,
under the compact of Chinandega, was effected at
San Vicente, in Salvador, on the 29th of March, 1844;
Fruto Chamorro, delegate from Nicaragua, being
chosen supremo delegado, Juan Lindo, delegate from
Honduras, president of the council, and Justo Herrera,
ex-jefe of the same state, secretary of that body.
The installation of the confederate government was
at once communicated to the several states.
</p>

<p>
Honduras, on the 27th of April, recognized and
accepted what had been done at San Vicente. Salvador
and Nicaragua expressed much satisfaction.
The reactionary government of Guatemala kept silent,
and on being pressed for an answer, returned a cold
and laconic one, to the effect that the matter would
be laid before the legislative body; that is to say, the
assembly which, on the 17th of April, 1839, had declared
the Central American confederation dissolved.<a name='FA_X-9' id='FA_X-9' href='#FN_X-9' class='fnanchor'>[X-9]</a>
It could not be expected that such an assembly would
give its assent. The committee to which the subject
was referred made an unfavorable report, which the
assembly accepted. Costa Rica suggested amendments
to the 'pacto de Chinandega.'<a name='FA_X-10' id='FA_X-10' href='#FN_X-10' class='fnanchor'>[X-10]</a> This document

never had any practical value, for the governments
which were parties thereto took no account of
the duties it imposed on them. It will be seen that
the executive of Honduras was its covert enemy, and
that the government of Salvador openly infringed a
number of its clauses.

<p class="sidenote">
MALESPIN AND ARCE.
</p>

<p>
Malespin, president of Salvador, was arranging affairs
for a change in favor of a theocratic régime to
please Viteri, bishop of San Salvador, when news
came that the state had been invaded at Atiquizaya
by Manuel José Arce. The ex-president had with
him troops of Guatemala, and a supply of arms and
ammunition to put in the hands of Malespin's enemies.
The question will be asked, Why did the aristocrats
of Guatemala cause the invasion of Salvador,
her executive being their agent Malespin, who was,
moreover, under the control of Bishop Viteri? This
is easily explained. Malespin was, in the eyes of the
aristocrats, another Carrera, disposed at times to slip
out of their hands. It was, therefore, important to
have him superseded by Arce, when affairs in the
state would go on smoothly and to their satisfaction.
In Arce ruling over Salvador, they would have, besides,
a support against Carrera.<a name='FA_X-11' id='FA_X-11' href='#FN_X-11' class='fnanchor'>[X-11]</a> But the people of
Salvador, albeit much dissatisfied with Malespin and
Viteri, were decidedly opposed to Arce with aristocratic
surroundings. His invasion of the state only
served to strengthen Malespin's power for a time.
The president set the whole state in motion to meet
the emergency. He did even more: he asked for the
assistance of the supremo delegado of the confederacy,
which was promised him. Each state was to
furnish 1,000 men; but meanwhile Salvador was to
place 2,000 men at the disposal of the confederate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_191' name='Page_191' href='#Page_191'>191</a></span>
executive.<a name='FA_X-12' id='FA_X-12' href='#FN_X-12' class='fnanchor'>[X-12]</a> The general government agreed to use
its utmost endeavors to avert the subjugation of Salvador
by Guatemala. Malespin was enjoined, on his
part, to confine his military operations within the territory
of his own state. He easily got together in a
few days at San Salvador 4,000 men, with which force
he marched to the front. One portion of the vanguard,
under Lieutenant-colonel Pedro Escalon, on
the 5th of May, reached the Chingo Valley in pursuit
of Arce, Aquilino San Martin, and Guillermo
Quintanilla, who fled to their headquarters at Coatepeque.
They were attacked there, and took to flight
a second time, leaving a large quantity of arms and
ammunition. Another portion of the vanguard occupied
Chalchuapa, placing a force and the artillery at
Santa Ana.<a name='FA_X-13' id='FA_X-13' href='#FN_X-13' class='fnanchor'>[X-13]</a>

Malespin, in disregard of the command he had received
from the supremo delegado, marched triumphantly
to Jutiapa, in Guatemala; in consequence of
which, the government of Rivera Paz assumed that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_192' name='Page_192' href='#Page_192'>192</a></span>
Guatemala was in a state of war, her territory having
been invaded; and Carrera was called upon to use
her forces against the invaders. A forced loan was
decreed, and a change took place in the cabinet, Manuel
F. Pavon assuming the portfolios of relations,
government, and war.<a name='FA_X-14' id='FA_X-14' href='#FN_X-14' class='fnanchor'>[X-14]</a> Pavon was certainly the
man for the occasion.<a name='FA_X-15' id='FA_X-15' href='#FN_X-15' class='fnanchor'>[X-15]</a> He returned an answer to
a note from the minister of the supremo delegado,
which Milla, his biographer, has pronounced an able
and conclusive one. But it was in reality a mass of
abuse against Salvador and Malespin. He did not
attempt to show that Arce's invasion was not the act
of the Guatemalan government, as he should have
done; but claimed that the war against Malespin was
not a consequence of Arce's act, but of the malice of
the Salvadoreños.<a name='FA_X-16' id='FA_X-16' href='#FN_X-16' class='fnanchor'>[X-16]</a>

The bad climate of Jutiapa soon began to decimate
the Salvador army, reducing it to about 3,000 men.
Moreover, the government of Salvador, then in
charge of Vice-president Guzman, could not easily
procure means for the support of such a force. It
was quite evident that the time for upsetting Carrera
had not yet come; and Malespin's defeat would
only bring greater outrages upon the people. Patience
was necessary under the circumstances. It
was consequently decided to abandon Jutiapa and recross

Guatemala determined that it should be held valid

Bishop Viteri undertook to accomplish this,
and succeeded.<a name='FA_X-21' id='FA_X-21' href='#FN_X-21' class='fnanchor'>[X-21]</a> Malespin gave his assent to the

Leon, who had been driven from Honduras by Ferrera,

The pacto de Chinandega, as we have seen, had become
a dead letter. Honduras and Salvador entered,
on the 10th of July, 1844, at San Salvador, into a

Chamorro's government was notified by Ferrera
that auxiliary forces from Nicaragua would no longer
be allowed to traverse Honduran territory.<a name='FA_X-24' id='FA_X-24' href='#FN_X-24' class='fnanchor'>[X-24]</a> Chamorro's
minister, M. Aguilar, remonstrated against a

was a component part.<a name='FA_X-25' id='FA_X-25' href='#FN_X-25' class='fnanchor'>[X-25]</a> Chamorro, using his lawful
authority, ordered J. Trinidad Muñoz, who commanded
the Honduras force of operations, not to
obstruct the passage of the Nicaraguan troops. Muñoz
disobeyed the order; and upon the Nicaraguans arriving
at Choluteca, on the 17th of August, he required
them to leave the territory of Honduras
forthwith; which not being done, he assailed and conquered
them on the 19th, after a three hours' fight.<a name='FA_X-26' id='FA_X-26' href='#FN_X-26' class='fnanchor'>[X-26]</a>
This action had a great influence on the fate of Central
America; for it satisfied the aristocrats of Guatemala
that the supremo delegado had no means for
enforcing his authority or for carrying out his plans.
It was virtually a declaration of war between Honduras
and Nicaragua. Malespin was likewise emboldened
by it to assail Nicaragua. The latter must
then move with the utmost activity against Ferrera,
before Malespin, now at peace with Guatemala, could
come to his aid. But difficulties that could not be
overcome were in the way; and it was only on the
23d of October that upwards of 1,000 Nicaraguans
appeared before Nacaome, which they assaulted the
next day, and after two hours of hard fighting, were
repulsed.<a name='FA_X-27' id='FA_X-27' href='#FN_X-27' class='fnanchor'>[X-27]</a>

WAR ON NICARAGUA.
</p>

<p>
Trinidad Cabañas and Gerardo Barrios, two of
Morazan's officers, made, on the 5th of September,
1844, an attempt at San Miguel to overthrow Malespin
without bloodshed; but having failed, they went
off to Nicaragua by way of La Union. Malespin's
minister, José Antonio Jimenez, then demanded of
the Nicaraguan government that Cabañas and Barrios
should be either expelled or surrendered to Salvador
for punishment. The demand was rejected.
The two officers were by no means discouraged. They
persevered in their efforts, which, more than anything
else, finally brought about the tyrant's overthrow.
By virtue of a special decree, Malespin took,
on the 25th of October, personal command of the
state forces, placing the executive office in charge of
the vice-president, Joaquin Eufracio Guzman, who
on the same day entered upon the discharge of his
duties, giving Malespin unlimited powers for the defence
of the state. Such authorization did not justify
Malespin's carrying the war into Nicaragua.<a name='FA_X-28' id='FA_X-28' href='#FN_X-28' class='fnanchor'>[X-28]</a> This
state, after the defeat of its troops at Nacaome, had
removed them from Honduran territory, and sued
for peace. And yet Malespin, in violation of the
laws of Salvador, made preparations for an offensive
war against Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
It will be well, before relating the events of this
campaign, to cast an eye upon the present lamentable
condition of the four states thus bent upon each other's
destruction. Guatemala was ruled by the aristocrats
with a rod of iron. Her financial affairs were completely
disorganized. In Salvador Malespin had no
other rule of conduct than his own will and Bishop
Viteri's evil counsels. He believed himself surrounded
by enemies, and indeed he was.<a name='FA_X-29' id='FA_X-29' href='#FN_X-29' class='fnanchor'>[X-29]</a> Honduras was in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
disturbed state, and the victim of Ferrera's despotism.
Nicaragua was in anything but a satisfactory situation.
The men who with their superior talents,
statesmanship, and influence might have carried the
ship of state safely through the coming storm, Francisco
Castellon and Máximo Jerez, were in Europe
working to undo the evils wrought against Central
America by Pavon and Chatfield. The director of
the state, Manuel Perez,<a name='FA_X-30' id='FA_X-30' href='#FN_X-30' class='fnanchor'>[X-30]</a> lacked the prestige that
the occasion required. Casto Fonseca, the commander
of the forces, had been given the rank of

</p>

<p>
The pacto de Chinandega had ceased to exist.
Owing to hostile acts of Malespin, Chamorro had to
seek safety in flight. Ferrera treated Chamorro
with contumely, and shamefully abused him in a
report to the chambers of Honduras, in January
1846.<a name='FA_X-32' id='FA_X-32' href='#FN_X-32' class='fnanchor'>[X-32]</a> Malespin and his army against Nicaragua
entered Honduras, and at Nacaome made an address
to the president and army of Honduras.<a name='FA_X-33' id='FA_X-33' href='#FN_X-33' class='fnanchor'>[X-33]</a> The two
allied presidents had a conference at Sauce on the
7th of November, and agreed that Malespin should
be recognized as the general-in-chief of their forces.
At Choluteca proposals for peace came from Leon;
and on the 21st of the same month the treaty of
Zatoca<a name='FA_X-34' id='FA_X-34' href='#FN_X-34' class='fnanchor'>[X-34]</a> was concluded, which was disgraceful to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_197' name='Page_197' href='#Page_197'>197</a></span>
Nicaraguan negotiators.<a name='FA_X-35' id='FA_X-35' href='#FN_X-35' class='fnanchor'>[X-35]</a> A secret clause was also
agreed to, binding Nicaragua, among other things, to
retire her troops from Chinandega to Chichigalpa.
But the authorities and people of Leon preferred
death with honor to submission to such degrading
demands. The treaty and secret clause were indignantly
rejected. Perez, the director, surrendered the
executive office to Senator Emiliano Madrid.

ATTACK ON LEON.
</p>

In the night of November 21st the allied forces
encamped in the barranca de San Antonio.<a name='FA_X-36' id='FA_X-36' href='#FN_X-36' class='fnanchor'>[X-36]</a> On the
26th, at 8 in the evening, they were in front of Leon,
and threw bombs into the city. The next morning
at 3 o'clock Malespin, being drunk, ordered an assault,
which resulted disastrously for the invaders; for at
sunrise he found his camp strewn with corpses.<a name='FA_X-37' id='FA_X-37' href='#FN_X-37' class='fnanchor'>[X-37]</a>
The attack was, however, continued that day till 4
o'clock in the afternoon, when the allies found themselves
short of ammunition, and with many of their
chief officers killed or wounded. Discord now broke
out among them, and the Hondurans wanted to
abandon the campaign; but J. Trinidad Muñoz, acting
for Malespin, quieted them, and the struggle went
on. That night Muñoz erected intrenchments, and
at break of day on the 28th the allies were in condition
to act vigorously.<a name='FA_X-38' id='FA_X-38' href='#FN_X-38' class='fnanchor'>[X-38]</a>

to which no ratification was given in the city, and the
war continued. Meanwhile there was much agitation
in Salvador, with occasional revolutionary attempts,
which becoming known at Leon, emboldened the
authorities and citizens to keep up the fight, notwithstanding
the other departments had turned against
them.<a name='FA_X-40' id='FA_X-40' href='#FN_X-40' class='fnanchor'>[X-40]</a>

SIEGE OF LEON.
</p>

<p>
Several partial actions took place in other parts of
the department of Leon, which turned out favorably
for the invaders.<a name='FA_X-42' id='FA_X-42' href='#FN_X-42' class='fnanchor'>[X-42]</a> But Malespin was furious at his
failure thus far to capture Leon. The firing of his
guns was incessant. He made a final effort, throwing
himself at the head of a force upon the works of
Sutiaba, which were in charge of Gerardo Barrios;
and after some hours' hard fighting was repulsed,
leaving the field covered with his killed and wounded.
But there was no unity of action in the city at this
time. Some officers believed that Casto Fonseca,
though brave, was not competent to make a proper
defence; and one of them, named José M. Valle, alias
El Chelon, suggested that he should turn over the
command to Cabañas. Fonseca looked upon the suggestion
as an insult, and in consequence Valle retired,
and Cabañas became an object of suspicion to Fonseca.
The siege with its horrors continued. The
fatal spirit of localism that maintained discord between
the several towns, specially between Granada
and Leon, was now as ever, and till the transfer of
the capital from Leon to Managua, a great misfortune
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_200' name='Page_200' href='#Page_200'>200</a></span>
for the whole country. The besiegers made the most
of it.<a name='FA_X-43' id='FA_X-43' href='#FN_X-43' class='fnanchor'>[X-43]</a>
</p>

<p>
A vessel arrived at this time at Realejo with arms
for the besieged, of which Malespin got information
from the Englishman Manning, and through Selva's
agent he obtained possession of 1,000 muskets, 200
rifles, 200 barrels of powder, 200 quintals of lead, and
12,000 flints. With this supply the operations against
Leon were pushed with still greater vigor, and the
city succumbed to an assault by Guardiola on the
24th of January, 1845. Malespin now gave full sway
to his bloody instincts, by shooting a number of
prominent citizens and surrendering the town to the
soldiery for plunder.<a name='FA_X-44' id='FA_X-44' href='#FN_X-44' class='fnanchor'>[X-44]</a> The outrages committed defy

<p class="sidenote">INDEPENDENCE OF SALVADOR.</p>

<p class="p2">
While Malespin was engaged in the Nicaragua
campaign, the state of Salvador was preparing to
throw off the yoke, and his brother Calixto was issuing
arbitrary orders without the knowledge or assent of
Vice-president Guzman. At last, at midnight between
the 30th and 31st of December, 1844, the garrison
at San Salvador was surprised by a party of
armed men from the Calvario, and captured, together
with the arms in the barracks.<a name='FA_X-46' id='FA_X-46' href='#FN_X-46' class='fnanchor'>[X-46]</a> After that the revolt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_201' name='Page_201' href='#Page_201'>201</a></span>
went on gaining large proportions; but the rebels
were defeated in the plain of Jucuapa, Cojutepeque,
on the 4th of January, 1845.
</p>

<p>
The liberal chiefs Cabañas and Barrios, who escaped
from Nicaragua, reached La Union. Barrios,<a name='FA_X-47' id='FA_X-47' href='#FN_X-47' class='fnanchor'>[X-47]</a>
with the view of rousing the Salvadorans, spread the
report that Malespin had succumbed at Leon. Cabañas,
a truthful man, disliked the scheme, but finally
allowed his companion to pursue his plan without
contradiction. They both entered San Miguel on
the 28th of January, 1845, and loudly congratulated
his friends and acquaintances on Malespin's defeat.
The whole department was soon in commotion, and
letters poured upon Guzman to sound the cry for liberty.
Calixto Malespin continued his arbitrary acts,
and Guzman concluded to oust him from his command,
without bloodshed if possible. In this he was
successful on the 2d of February;<a name='FA_X-48' id='FA_X-48' href='#FN_X-48' class='fnanchor'>[X-48]</a> the barracks
were soon surrendered to him, the troops following
his lead. The capital seconded the movement, and
was soon followed by the other departments.<a name='FA_X-49' id='FA_X-49' href='#FN_X-49' class='fnanchor'>[X-49]</a> The
government sent a circular to the other states announcing
the change effected, and it was recognized
by all but Honduras.<a name='FA_X-50' id='FA_X-50' href='#FN_X-50' class='fnanchor'>[X-50]</a>
</p>

<p>
The chambers of Salvador assembled on the 15th,
before which Guzman made an energetic speech, and
Malespin was not only dethroned, but his election to
the presidency was declared null.<a name='FA_X-51' id='FA_X-51' href='#FN_X-51' class='fnanchor'>[X-51]</a> However, there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
was much to do yet to uproot him from Central
American politics, as he had the support of Honduras.
In an encounter at Quelepa Cabañas was defeated,
which gave the reactionists courage to approach San
Vicente; but public opinion was now so clearly pronounced
against Malespin that Bishop Viteri turned
against him, and began his efforts to win over to the
clerico-oligarchic party the new president, Joaquin
Eufracio Guzman.<a name='FA_X-52' id='FA_X-52' href='#FN_X-52' class='fnanchor'>[X-52]</a> He at once issued a decree of
excommunication against Ex-president Malespin.<a name='FA_X-53' id='FA_X-53' href='#FN_X-53' class='fnanchor'>[X-53]</a>
But the government of Honduras being bent on supporting
Malespin at all hazards, Guardiola landed at
La Union with an armed force, and occupied San
Miguel; notwithstanding which act Guzman did not
declare war against Honduras. Attributing it to
ignorance of the true state of affairs in Salvador, he
sent a second note, which, like the first, remained unanswered.
Malespin continued—with the assent of
Honduras, and without that of Nicaragua, which had
assumed neutrality in the contest—calling himself
general-in-chief of the armies of Salvador, Honduras,
and Nicaragua, and declared Guzman, the Salvadoran

chambers, and the inhabitants of upwards of
100 towns which had set him aside, guilty of treason.
</p>

<p>
Guzman was now menaced from several quarters;
namely, from Malespin's partisans in San Salvador,
the military at Comayagua, J. Trinidad Muñoz, who
wanted to destroy the liberals that had escaped from
Leon, and lastly, Rafael Carrera, who, though at
times inclined to wheedle the liberals, generally had
his claws ready to tear them to pieces. Guzman
found the panther more untractable than the other
wild beasts. It was therefore necessary to place in
Guatemala experienced tamers; but he was unsuccessful
in this. His commissioners, though they
managed by fawning to approach Carrera, met with
poor success in their mission.<a name='FA_X-54' id='FA_X-54' href='#FN_X-54' class='fnanchor'>[X-54]</a>

which he entered amidst the plaudits of the people.<a name='FA_X-55' id='FA_X-55' href='#FN_X-55' class='fnanchor'>[X-55]</a>
Malespin entered with him into a convention at Jocoro,
binding himself to surrender all national property of
Salvador and to leave the country. But the authorities
of Honduras disapproved the arrangement, and
it fell to the ground;<a name='FA_X-56' id='FA_X-56' href='#FN_X-56' class='fnanchor'>[X-56]</a> the war continued, till on the
18th of April a treaty of peace and friendship was
concluded at Chinameca, to which the minister of
Salvador, Dueñas, added another clause, requiring
that both Salvador and Honduras should disband
their troops immediately after the ratification of the
treaty.<a name='FA_X-57' id='FA_X-57' href='#FN_X-57' class='fnanchor'>[X-57]</a> Honduras failed to ratify it, and proposed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
that new conferences should be held at Gualcinse,
and at the same time despatched 900 men upon that
place under Malespin. Armed parties from Honduras
invaded Salvador; and, indeed, Ferrera was using all
possible means to exasperate the latter state into committing
acts of hostility against the former, so that
Carrera might have an opportunity to take a hand in
the game.
</p>

<p>
The chambers of Salvador assembled at this time,
and Minister Dueñas reported a treaty of peace, amity,
and alliance with Guatemala.<a name='FA_X-58' id='FA_X-58' href='#FN_X-58' class='fnanchor'>[X-58]</a> He seemed to expect
aid from that side of the river Paz.<a name='FA_X-59' id='FA_X-59' href='#FN_X-59' class='fnanchor'>[X-59]</a> Nicaragua had
extended a friendly reception to two Salvador commissioners.<a name='FA_X-60' id='FA_X-60' href='#FN_X-60' class='fnanchor'>[X-60]</a>
The chambers gave Guzman ample
powers for the defence of the state. This did not
include authority to invade any other state, unless as
a retaliatory measure. A resort to this was finally resolved
upon, and a Salvadoran army under Cabañas
marched the 24th of May upon Comayagua, meeting
with defeat there on the 2d of June, and again at
Sensenti on the 10th of the same month.<a name='FA_X-61' id='FA_X-61' href='#FN_X-61' class='fnanchor'>[X-61]</a> The Hondureños

Ferrera, now flushed with victory, thought that he
could dictate terms to Salvador.<a name='FA_X-62' id='FA_X-62' href='#FN_X-62' class='fnanchor'>[X-62]</a> It was a mistake
on his part, for the people of Salvador rose en masse
to repair the disasters of Comayagua and Sensenti.

Guardiola committed many acts of vandalism in
La Union, in consequence of which Minister Dueñas,
on the 25th of July, addressed a circular to the agents
of foreign nations protesting against the seizure of
foreign goods in the government's warehouse at that
port. Cabañas, after the disasters before related,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
arrived at San Miguel with scarcely fifty men, and
endeavored to collect his scattered forces; but his

the inhabitants—and gave it up to be plundered by
his soldiers.<a name='FA_X-63' id='FA_X-63' href='#FN_X-63' class='fnanchor'>[X-63]</a>

All that part of Salvador on the Lempa and the
district of Chalatenango were in the hands of the
enemy, who acted as the master of a conquered
country. One of the commanders was the notorious
Manuel Quijano. The Salvadoreños attacked him
and were defeated. The Hondurans now felt certain
that they could capture San Salvador. But on the

peace, amity, and alliance was concluded on the 27th
of November, 1845, under which Malespin and Espinosa
were forbidden to set foot in Salvador without
leave of her government.<a name='FA_X-67' id='FA_X-67' href='#FN_X-67' class='fnanchor'>[X-67]</a>

GUATEMALAN INDEPENDENCE.
</p>

<p>
The government of Guatemala, with a view of not
too openly going counter to public opinion in the
states desiring to see a national government established,
inserted in the treaty concluded with Salvador on the
4th of April, 1845, a clause apparently intended to
promote that end.<a name='FA_X-68' id='FA_X-68' href='#FN_X-68' class='fnanchor'>[X-68]</a> And yet it was at the same time
considering the expediency of declaring the entire
independence of Guatemala, and gathering material
which was made public in a manifesto in March 1847.
Indeed, she had no desire to carry out the stipulations,
though she named Joaquin Duran and Doctor Mariano
Padilla her commissioners.<a name='FA_X-69' id='FA_X-69' href='#FN_X-69' class='fnanchor'>[X-69]</a> Pretexts were not
wanting, and new commissioners appointed, namely,
Marure and Rodriguez, both of whom favored Guatemala's
absolute independence. The result was the
abandonment of the plan of reorganization as entirely
impracticable.<a name='FA_X-70' id='FA_X-70' href='#FN_X-70' class='fnanchor'>[X-70]</a> The declaration of independence was
made in the decree of March 21, 1847.<a name='FA_X-71' id='FA_X-71' href='#FN_X-71' class='fnanchor'>[X-71]</a> Carrera,
the president, in a manifesto, set forth the causes that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_208' name='Page_208' href='#Page_208'>208</a></span>
had prompted such a measure, which he called one of
regeneration, and asked the people to greet it with
the same enthusiasm that was shown in 1821, when
the cry for separation from Spain was raised.<a name='FA_X-72' id='FA_X-72' href='#FN_X-72' class='fnanchor'>[X-72]</a>
</p>

<p>
The secessionists pronounced it an able effort; but
it caused a disagreeable impression in the states, and
in none more so than in Salvador. It wounded public
sentiment. Carrera had no legal right to take
such a step. The constituent assembly had placed
him in charge of the executive, but had not made him
a legislator. For all that, the separation from the
rest of Central America became an accomplished fact,
and Carrera was declared a hero, the founder of the
republic, and coin was struck with his bust on it.<a name='FA_X-73' id='FA_X-73' href='#FN_X-73' class='fnanchor'>[X-73]</a>
This act was ratified on the 14th of September, 1848,
by the constituent assembly of Guatemala, when
Carrera was no longer in power.
</p>

<p>
Lindo was ruling in Honduras and Guerrero in
Nicaragua, but these two states were in accord with
Salvador, from fear of British pretensions, on the necessity
of a Central American union. They constituted,
early in 1848, the diet of Nacaome, which urgently
invited Guatemala and Costa Rica to join it; but
the former peremptorily declined, alleging that the
decree of March 21st precluded her taking any step
backward. Costa Rica sent deputies to Nacaome.<a name='FA_X-74' id='FA_X-74' href='#FN_X-74' class='fnanchor'>[X-74]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_209' name='Page_209' href='#Page_209'>209</a></span>
The celebrated Ecuatorian general, Juan José Flores,
arrived in Costa Rica in July 1848, and was received
with much consideration, which flattered his vanity.
He wanted the aid of Costa Rica for his own plans,
and got himself into the good graces of President
Castro. The dissolution of the Colombian republic
had enabled him to become the ruler of Ecuador; and
being of the same way of thinking as Pavon and his
fellow-secessionists of Guatemala, he counselled a
complete separation of the states of Central America.
Several influential men of Costa Rica favored the
policy of a wholly independent government for their
state.<a name='FA_X-75' id='FA_X-75' href='#FN_X-75' class='fnanchor'>[X-75]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
REPUBLIC OF COSTA RICA.
</p>

<p>
Congress, on the 30th of August, 1848, consummated
the work of final separation, with a decree declaring
that the title 'Estado de Costa Rica' was not
in consonance with the 22d article of the constitution,
which established the principle of Costa Rica's
sovereignty, freedom, and independence; that with
this understanding, and as a free, sovereign, and independent
nation, other powers had treated with her
on a footing of equality. It was therefore resolved,
carrying out the wishes of the municipal districts,
that the term 'república' be substituted for that of
'estado.'<a name='FA_X-76' id='FA_X-76' href='#FN_X-76' class='fnanchor'>[X-76]</a> President Castro sanctioned its promulgation
on the 31st.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding so many difficulties, the friends of
union never resigned the hope of accomplishing their
purpose. In November 1849 commissioners of Honduras,
Salvador, and Nicaragua assembled at Leon,
and on the 8th agreed upon a basis of union of the
three states, the terms of which were subsequently
promulgated;<a name='FA_X-77' id='FA_X-77' href='#FN_X-77' class='fnanchor'>[X-77]</a> and it was left optional with Guatemala
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
and Costa Rica to join it or not. The remnants
of the aristocratic element, with the support of British
officials,<a name='FA_X-78' id='FA_X-78' href='#FN_X-78' class='fnanchor'>[X-78]</a> opposed the union, and in order to defeat
it, promoted revolutions in Nicaragua and Honduras.
The compact went into effect, however, on
the 9th of January, 1851, when the national representatives
assembled in Chinandega, José F. Barrundia,
representative from Salvador, being chosen their
president.<a name='FA_X-79' id='FA_X-79' href='#FN_X-79' class='fnanchor'>[X-79]</a>

The national constituent congress was installed at

A SHORT-LIVED FEDERATION.

<p>
Trinidad Cabañas was on the 13th elected jefe supremo
of the federation, but he declined the honor,
being desirous of disarming opposition to the new
organization on the part of his political opponents.
His resignation was accepted on the 26th, and Francisco

was held by Pedro Molina, vice-jefe, four senators,
and two acting ministers of state. The federation
thus organized was not destined to be long lived.
Upon the allegation that the congress had created
a dictatorship, and referred the organic statute to
the people instead of the legislatures of the states,
the assemblies of Salvador and Nicaragua set aside
the federation, and declared themselves independent
states.<a name='FA_X-83' id='FA_X-83' href='#FN_X-83' class='fnanchor'>[X-83]</a> Nicaragua may have receded from that act;
but whether it was so or not, the union between Honduras
and Nicaragua was dissolved by the war which
broke out in February 1863 between Salvador and
Guatemala, Honduras joining one of those states, and
Nicaragua the other. Further efforts have been
made from time to time—1871-76, and even as
late as 1885—to accomplish the union of the states
under one government; but obstacles have been in
the way, the chief doubtlessly being the personal ambition
or jealousy of rulers, and the project still remains
as a possible event to come about in a few
years, as it is believed to be much desired by the
majority of Central Americans.<a name='FA_X-84' id='FA_X-84' href='#FN_X-84' class='fnanchor'>[X-84]</a>

Carrillo, believing himself clothed with unlimited
authority, on the 8th of March, 1841, issued what he
called a '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ley de garantias,</span>' giving himself a life tenure
of office and inviolability.<a name='FA_XI-1' id='FA_XI-1' href='#FN_XI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XI-1]</a> The supreme government

Peru.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
MORAZAN AND SARAVIA.
</p>

<p>
Morazan sailed from Chiriquí in Panamá, and after
visiting several places in Central America landed
with about 500 men at Caldera<a name='FA_XI-5' id='FA_XI-5' href='#FN_XI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XI-5]</a> on the 7th of April,
1842. With him were generals Saget, Cabañas, Saravia,
and Rascon.<a name='FA_XI-6' id='FA_XI-6' href='#FN_XI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XI-6]</a> Carrillo heard of the invasion
in the evening of the 8th, and at once assumed personal
command of the troops to operate against the
enemy, turning over the executive office to Bonilla,
the vice-jefe,<a name='FA_XI-7' id='FA_XI-7' href='#FN_XI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XI-7]</a> and providing other measures for an
active campaign. Nearly 1,000 men under Colonel
Vicente Villaseñor composed the expedition, among
whose captains and lieutenants were some of the
wealthiest persons in the country.<a name='FA_XI-8' id='FA_XI-8' href='#FN_XI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XI-8]</a> Morazan had
issued a manifesto assuring the Costa Ricans that his
policy would be one of order, union, and progress, to
accomplish which Braulio Carrillo must be ousted
from power. As the government forces approached
the invaders, Villaseñor made known its contents to
his command, and asked whether they were for fighting
or for a peaceable arrangement. Both officers and
men almost unanimously<a name='FA_XI-9' id='FA_XI-9' href='#FN_XI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XI-9]</a> favored the latter, and a
convention was concluded at Jocote on the 11th of
April, by virtue of which the two forces fraternized,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
becoming one army. It was further agreed that a
constituent assembly should be called to reorganize
the state, the government meanwhile remaining in
charge of Morazan, or in his absence in that of Vicente
Villaseñor.<a name='FA_XI-10' id='FA_XI-10' href='#FN_XI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XI-10]</a> This convention was accepted on the
next day at San José by Carrillo, with a few additions
which did in no wise vitiate it, and Morazan afterward
ratified the whole at Heredia.<a name='FA_XI-11' id='FA_XI-11' href='#FN_XI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XI-11]</a> He was enthusiastically
welcomed at Alajuela and Heredia, and with an
augmented force marched on San José, which he
entered without hindrance. As jefe supremo provisorio
he made José Miguel Saravia his sole minister
of state, and issued a proclamation embodying complete
forgetfulness of all past political offences, and
tendering an asylum in Costa Rica to all persons, of
whatever party, suffering persecution in the other
states.<a name='FA_XI-12' id='FA_XI-12' href='#FN_XI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XI-12]</a> He next appointed a committee to revise
the laws enacted by Carrillo, with the view of repealing
such as were deemed unwise or arbitrary, and a
number of them were accordingly annulled, the preposterous
one of March 8, 1841, not being, of course,
excepted. The state constitution of January 21, 1825,
was revived, and the people were called upon to elect
a constituent assembly, which was to meet at San
José on the 10th of July.<a name='FA_XI-13' id='FA_XI-13' href='#FN_XI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XI-13]</a> This body, composed of
thirteen members, one of whom was the distinguished
ex-jefe Juan Mora, was installed on the appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_218' name='Page_218' href='#Page_218'>218</a></span>
day under the presidency of José F. Peralta, deputy
for Cartago, and on the 15th of July unanimously
elected Morazan provisional jefe of the state.<a name='FA_XI-14' id='FA_XI-14' href='#FN_XI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XI-14]</a>
</p>

<p>
The great political change thus effected in Costa
Rica greatly alarmed the reactionists; and specially
those of Guatemala, who lost no time in adopting
measures to destroy Morazan. This chief, on the
other hand, took steps toward the reorganization of
Central America, equipping troops therefor. Some of
his measures were deemed too severe, giving rise to
rebellion in some localities. There were intimate relations
between Carrera of Guatemala and General
Antonio Pinto of Costa Rica, as well as between the
serviles of both states, who, together with the clergy,
worked to promote a revolt. An attempt in Guanacaste
by Colonel Manuel A. Molina failed, and caused
his arrest, trial, and execution at Puntarenas.<a name='FA_XI-15' id='FA_XI-15' href='#FN_XI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XI-15]</a> Colonel
Molina was a son of Pedro Molina, the noted
champion of free principles, and however legal his
execution may have been, it was certainly impolitic.
His sentence might have been commuted, thus averting
the disruption which at once broke out in the
liberal ranks.<a name='FA_XI-16' id='FA_XI-16' href='#FN_XI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XI-16]</a>

WAR AND REBELLION.
</p>

<p>
Saget was at Puntarenas attending to the embarkation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'>219</a></span>
of 45 officers, 200 men, 2,000 or 3,000 muskets,
and about 1,300 pounds of powder and lead. At Alajuela
were 300 recruits of that department and 100 of
Cartago, all commanded by Florentin Alfaro. This
officer was won over by Morazan's enemies, and revolting
on the 11th of September marched upon San José,
where the people followed his example. The revolutionists
then called General Pinto to the command.<a name='FA_XI-17' id='FA_XI-17' href='#FN_XI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XI-17]</a>
Morazan's body-guard of forty Salvadorans thrice repulsed
the assailants, but finally had to retreat to the
chief barracks.<a name='FA_XI-18' id='FA_XI-18' href='#FN_XI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XI-18]</a> The jefe, together with Cordero, Cabañas,
and Saravia, and 80 men sustained another terrible
onslaught on the 12th. The besiegers were constantly
on the increase till they numbered 5,000, and
the besieged on the decrease by death and desertion.<a name='FA_XI-19' id='FA_XI-19' href='#FN_XI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XI-19]</a>
Chaplain José Antonio Castro came to propose a
capitulation based on Morazan's abandonment of the
country, and a pledge of security to his supporters.
Believing that his loyalty and military honor were at
stake, Morazan declined the propositions.<a name='FA_XI-20' id='FA_XI-20' href='#FN_XI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XI-20]</a> Pinto's
secretary, Vicente Herrera, was very virulent, demanding
Morazan's blood; and the chaplain reported
that the jefe wanted war, refusing to recognize any
authority on the part of his adversaries to give pledges,
which enraged their commander and his secretary all
the more.<a name='FA_XI-21' id='FA_XI-21' href='#FN_XI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XI-21]</a> The fight continued, and blood flowed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'>220</a></span>
freely.<a name='FA_XI-22' id='FA_XI-22' href='#FN_XI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XI-22]</a> Mayorga, comandante at Cartago, rebelled,
and Morazan's situation had become a desperate one
on the 13th. No reënforcements could reach him, and
provisions were exhausted. Juan Mora and Chaplain
Castro endeavored to bring about an arrangement,
but the terms offered, being oppressive, were rejected.
The firing was resumed between one and two o'clock
in the morning of the 14th. Morazan and his handful
of supporters, worn out by fatigue, hunger, and
wounds, made their way through the besiegers and
reached Cartago,<a name='FA_XI-23' id='FA_XI-23' href='#FN_XI-23' class='fnanchor'>[XI-23]</a> Cabañas covering the retreat with
30 men. Mayorga's wife, who disapproved her husband's
disloyalty, sent them word of their danger.
But it came too late. Morazan and the rest were
surrounded and captured. Young Francisco Morazan
and Saravia, arriving a little later, were also secured.
Deception toward Cabañas was used,<a name='FA_XI-24' id='FA_XI-24' href='#FN_XI-24' class='fnanchor'>[XI-24]</a> and treachery
toward Morazan, who was promised his life.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
BLOODY WORK.
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning, an officer named Darío
Orozco came to inform Morazan and his companions
that they were to be put in irons, by demand of the
troops. Saravia rose and seized a pistol to blow his
brains out; but Morazan prevented the suicide, though
only for a few moments. He then walked a while
smoking, and finally submitted to have the shackles
put on his feet, and just as it was being done he had
a horrible convulsion which ended in death. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
said that he had swallowed poison. The shackles
were riveted on a corpse!<a name='FA_XI-25' id='FA_XI-25' href='#FN_XI-25' class='fnanchor'>[XI-25]</a> Villaseñor stabbed himself
with a dagger, and fell to the ground covered with
blood, unfortunately for him, not dead. Morazan was
shackled. The prisoners were at once taken to San
José. Morazan, though wounded, rode on horseback,
and Villaseñor was carried in a hammock; but on
arriving at the Cuesta de las Moras, Captain Benavides,
a Peruvian who commanded their guard, made
them walk to the court-house. Morazan on the way
conversed with Pardo and Vijil, and remembering
that it was the 15th of September, remarked to Vijil,
"How solemnly we are keeping the anniversary of independence!"
The other prisoners were confined in
the building called Los Almacenes, and Morazan was
left with Villaseñor as his sole companion.
</p>

<p>
Moderate men strongly urged a strict observance of
law, aside from prejudice or passion;<a name='FA_XI-26' id='FA_XI-26' href='#FN_XI-26' class='fnanchor'>[XI-26]</a> but their voice
was drowned in the uproar of the enemies of Morazan,<a name='FA_XI-27' id='FA_XI-27' href='#FN_XI-27' class='fnanchor'>[XI-27]</a>
clamoring for his death without form of trial,
regardless of the requirements of the constitution of
1825, and of the fact that he was the legitimate chief
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
of the state.<a name='FA_XI-28' id='FA_XI-28' href='#FN_XI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XI-28]</a> But nothing availed to save his life.
Pinto, like his prototype Pontius Pilate, after a slight
hesitation, signed the order of execution of both Morazan
and Villaseñor, to be carried out within three
hours. Morazan then summoned his son Francisco,
and dictated to him his last will and testament; some
of its clauses are epitomized below.<a name='FA_XI-29' id='FA_XI-29' href='#FN_XI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XI-29]</a> After placing
in charge of Montealegre a handkerchief and a few
other objects for his wife, so soon to become a widow,
he walked with dignity and a firm step to the place
of execution. Villaseñor, who was nearly dead from
his wound, was carried in a chair. On arriving at
the fatal spot Morazan embraced Villaseñor, saying,
"My dear friend, posterity will do us justice." Barrundia
thus describes the last moments of the ex-president:
He gave the order to prepare arms, saw
that a good aim was taken, then gave the command
to fire, and fell to the ground. Still raising his bleeding
head, he cried out: "I am yet alive;" when a second
volley despatched him. Thus on the 15th of
September, the anniversary of Central American independence,
just as the sun was sinking in the west,
the soul of the noble patriot returned to the region
whence it came.<a name='FA_XI-30' id='FA_XI-30' href='#FN_XI-30' class='fnanchor'>[XI-30]</a>

by its decree of the 5th of April, 1843, called upon the
people to send deputies to a constituent assembly.
This body was installed on the 1st of June, and soon
after adopted the groundwork upon which was to be
erected the fundamental law of the state.<a name='FA_XI-41' id='FA_XI-41' href='#FN_XI-41' class='fnanchor'>[XI-41]</a> The assembly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_225' name='Page_225' href='#Page_225'>225</a></span>
likewise enacted a law declaratory of the rights
of man; and another on freedom of the press under
certain limitations. Among the other acts worthy
of mention passed by this body were the following:
The jefe, Alfaro, was to hold his office till the promulgation
of the constitution and the election of his successor
under it. All his acts were approved, and a
vote of thanks was awarded him. A similar vote
was given to General Pinto. Francisco M. Oreamuno
was chosen segundo jefe, and a short time
afterward he was called to fill the executive chair,
upon leave of absence being given to Alfaro.<a name='FA_XI-42' id='FA_XI-42' href='#FN_XI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XI-42]</a> The
assembly adjourned on the 22d of September, to meet
again on the 13th of November. The constitutional
bases, nicknamed by the conservatives "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">de los tribunos,</span>"
did not meet the approval of the government.
The assembly then adopted a constitution, which
made provision for two chambers, the executive authority
being exercised by a jefe, as formerly, and all
the functionaries constituting the supreme powers
being chosen by the whole people. The promulgation
of the new fundamental law was made on the
11th of April, 1844,<a name='FA_XI-43' id='FA_XI-43' href='#FN_XI-43' class='fnanchor'>[XI-43]</a> and all officers were required
to take an oath to support it. Pinto, the comandante
general, refused to do so without first consulting
Alfaro and others. He tried to make an armed
opposition, but did not succeed, and was dismissed,
Colonel José María Quiroz superseding him.<a name='FA_XI-44' id='FA_XI-44' href='#FN_XI-44' class='fnanchor'>[XI-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
The publication of the new fundamental law was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_226' name='Page_226' href='#Page_226'>226</a></span>
celebrated with feasts for three days. But the fact of
Pinto's dismissal from the command of the forces
caused serious divisions in families,<a name='FA_XI-45' id='FA_XI-45' href='#FN_XI-45' class='fnanchor'>[XI-45]</a> which has been felt
ever since in the political events of the country. The
two chambers decreed by the constituent assembly
complicated the political machinery, and the enemies
of the new constitution exaggerated its defects. The
necessity of a senate in Costa Rica was not clear, for
the composition of the house of deputies was such
that it required impulsion rather than checks. Therefore,
what would be the mission of the senate?<a name='FA_XI-46' id='FA_XI-46' href='#FN_XI-46' class='fnanchor'>[XI-46]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
MOYA, GALLEGOS, AND ALFARO.

<p>
Alfaro reassumed the duties of the executive office
on the 28th of June, on which date Castro resigned
his position of secretary-general,<a name='FA_XI-47' id='FA_XI-47' href='#FN_XI-47' class='fnanchor'>[XI-47]</a> to take a seat in the
chamber of deputies, which was installed on the 3d
of July. The first duty of this body was to count the
votes for senators; but the returns were coming
in very slowly, so that the senate did not assemble
till the 12th of November.<a name='FA_XI-48' id='FA_XI-48' href='#FN_XI-48' class='fnanchor'>[XI-48]</a> Both houses then on
the 15th declared Francisco María Oreamuno duly
elected jefe of the state. He took possession of the
office with reluctance.<a name='FA_XI-49' id='FA_XI-49' href='#FN_XI-49' class='fnanchor'>[XI-49]</a> The spirit of localism which
caused so much trouble in 1835 was still rampant, and
Oreamuno found himself confronted by it. Whatever
measure was proposed in favor of any one locality
was certain to displease the others. Rather than
contend with such difficulties, he tendered, on the
26th of November, his resignation, which was not
accepted; but he was resolved to retire, and one day,
being more than usually disgusted, he abandoned his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_227' name='Page_227' href='#Page_227'>227</a></span>
post and went off to his home in Cartago.<a name='FA_XI-50' id='FA_XI-50' href='#FN_XI-50' class='fnanchor'>[XI-50]</a> His successor
was Rafael Moya, then president of the senate,<a name='FA_XI-51' id='FA_XI-51' href='#FN_XI-51' class='fnanchor'>[XI-51]</a>
who exerted himself to do away with localism, and
to promote harmony between the several sections; but
his senatorial term expiring on the 30th of April,
1845, he could no longer continue holding the executive
authority, and the chamber of deputies called to
assume its duties Senator José Rafael Gallegos,<a name='FA_XI-52' id='FA_XI-52' href='#FN_XI-52' class='fnanchor'>[XI-52]</a> who
was made chief of the state at the expiration of Juan
Moran's second term. He took the chair on the 1st
of May. An ominous cloud could already be descried
away in the horizon. The new constitution
had thus early become an object of abuse, even by
the men who had enthusiastically proclaimed it, and
acrimoniously censured Pinto for refusing it recognition.<a name='FA_XI-53' id='FA_XI-53' href='#FN_XI-53' class='fnanchor'>[XI-53]</a>
</p>

<p>
During the elections a bloodless revolt of four regiments
simultaneously occurred, on the 7th of June,
1846, at San José, Cartago, Heredia, and Alajuela,
to overthrow the organic law. The movement was
seconded at once by the people,<a name='FA_XI-54' id='FA_XI-54' href='#FN_XI-54' class='fnanchor'>[XI-54]</a> and José María
Alfaro was summoned to assume the reins of government,
Gallegos returning to the presidency of the senate.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
Every one recognized Gallegos as an upright
man, against whom no complaint was made.<a name='FA_XI-55' id='FA_XI-55' href='#FN_XI-55' class='fnanchor'>[XI-55]</a> Alfaro
accepted the rôle, went into office on the 9th, and immediately
proceeded to carry out the purposes of the
revolution. Elections took place under the existing
constitution, Alfaro being chosen jefe, and José M.
Castro vice-jefe and secretary-general. The latter
being the intellectual superior of Alfaro, every branch
of the administration finally fell under his control.
</p>

<p>
The constituent assembly met on the 15th of September,
and completed, on the 21st of January, 1847,
the new constitution, which was promulgated at once,
to have effect from and after the 7th of March.<a name='FA_XI-56' id='FA_XI-56' href='#FN_XI-56' class='fnanchor'>[XI-56]</a>
Experience having shown that several clauses of this
instrument were practically inexpedient, and that
others were not clearly worded, under article 187 of
the same congress subsequently adopted a number of
amendments, which had been asked for by a majority
of the municipalities.<a name='FA_XI-57' id='FA_XI-57' href='#FN_XI-57' class='fnanchor'>[XI-57]</a> The elections for supreme
authorities, decreed on the 17th of February, took
place; the constitutional congress assembled on the
1st of May, and after counting the votes for president
and vice-president on the 5th, declared Castro duly
elected for the first position and Alfaro for the second.

Costa Rica was the first state of Central America
to be recognized as an independent nation by Spain,
which was done in the treaty of May 10, 1850, which
was ratified by Costa Rica March 6, 1851. The republic
made a concordat with the Roman pontiff, for
the understanding of ecclesiastical affairs, on the 7th
of October, 1852. She has endeavored to maintain
cordial relations with the powers of Europe and
America. To that end she concluded treaties with
the United States of America, the Hanseatic Towns,
France,<a name='FA_XI-64' id='FA_XI-64' href='#FN_XI-64' class='fnanchor'>[XI-64]</a> Great Britain, Belgium, Holland, Italy,
Germany, and several of the Spanish-American republics.
With Guatemala a treaty was entered into
in February 1850, and the government awaited the
result of the efforts of the other three states to constitute
themselves under one nationality; and when
they failed, and the states assumed the rôle of independent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_231' name='Page_231' href='#Page_231'>231</a></span>

<p class="sidenote">
THE BOUNDARY QUESTION.
</p>

<p>
The boundaries of Costa Rica with Nicaragua on
one side, and with Panamá, one of the states of Colombia,
on the other, have been a source of constant
anxiety, repeatedly occupying the minds of the diplomates
of the three countries. Fortunately, the points
in dispute have been peaceably discussed by the governments,
though the press and politicians have not
always touched upon them with the same spirit. The
district of Nicoya or Guanacaste, at one time under
the government of Nicaragua, became annexed to
Costa Rica in 1824. This annexation was accepted
by the Costa Rican assembly, and the federal congress
allowed it, in a decree of December 9, 1825, as a provisional
arrangement, to be in force till an opportunity
was had to run the boundary between the two states.
This congress took no further action in the premises;
and since the dissolution of the Central American
union, the district remained attached to Costa Rica.
Nicaragua never assented to the segregation, though
she made no attempt to recover the territory by force
of arms. She has, however, endeavored to sustain
her right to it in repeated diplomatic negotiations.<a name='FA_XI-66' id='FA_XI-66' href='#FN_XI-66' class='fnanchor'>[XI-66]</a>
The time came when Nicaragua, being invaded by
William Walker's filibusters, and the independence of
all Central America threatened, the citizens of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
five republics at once saw the necessity of having the
question amicably settled.<a name='FA_XI-67' id='FA_XI-67' href='#FN_XI-67' class='fnanchor'>[XI-67]</a> The other republics, more
particularly Salvador, brought their influence to bear,
and a treaty was concluded, duly ratified, exchanged,
and published as the law, to govern the boundary between
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.<a name='FA_XI-68' id='FA_XI-68' href='#FN_XI-68' class='fnanchor'>[XI-68]</a> Under its second
article, both contracting parties ceded a portion of
their claims, Costa Rican territory not reaching the
lake, nor the Flor River, but merely the centre of
Salinas Bay. On the other hand, Nicaragua no longer
claimed territory to the Salto or Alvarado River, but
limited it to the aforesaid bay, and to the line prescribed
in the treaty.<a name='FA_XI-69' id='FA_XI-69' href='#FN_XI-69' class='fnanchor'>[XI-69]</a> The acts of several congresses
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'>233</a></span>
of Nicaragua in after years indicated that the treaty
was recognized beyond cavil or dispute. Not a word
was officially uttered by Nicaragua in seven years
against its validity. After such a period had elapsed,
Tomás Ayon, her minister of foreign affairs, in a report
to the national congress, disputed its validity,
and the boundary question was reopened,<a name='FA_XI-70' id='FA_XI-70' href='#FN_XI-70' class='fnanchor'>[XI-70]</a> giving rise
to grave diplomatic discussions, and no little ill feeling
between the citizens of both countries from 1868 to
1883.<a name='FA_XI-71' id='FA_XI-71' href='#FN_XI-71' class='fnanchor'>[XI-71]</a> At last, early in 1883, a treaty was signed in
Granada by plenipotentiaries of both countries to
bring the dispute to an end.<a name='FA_XI-72' id='FA_XI-72' href='#FN_XI-72' class='fnanchor'>[XI-72]</a> President Cárdenas,
in laying the treaty before the Nicaraguan congress
early in 1885, urged its favorable consideration; but
no action was taken.

DISPUTED TERRITORY.
</p>

<p>
Under the Gual-Molina treaty, concluded at Bogotá,
March 15, 1825, the Provincias Unidas del Centro
de América and the Republic of Colombia agreed to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_234' name='Page_234' href='#Page_234'>234</a></span>
respect the boundaries then existing between them,
and to enter at an early convenient opportunity into a
special convention directed to fix the dividing line.<a name='FA_XI-73' id='FA_XI-73' href='#FN_XI-73' class='fnanchor'>[XI-73]</a>
The antecedents of the subject will be found in a note
at foot.<a name='FA_XI-74' id='FA_XI-74' href='#FN_XI-74' class='fnanchor'>[XI-74]</a> All subsequent royal provisions, down to
1803, tend to confirm the limits of Costa Rica that
were fixed for Cherino on the Atlantic side. But on
the 20th of November, 1803, a royal order placed the
island of San Andrés, and the coast of Mosquito from
Cape Gracias á Dios to the River Chagres, under the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_235' name='Page_235' href='#Page_235'>235</a></span>
supervision of the viceroy at Bogotá. Nueva Granada,
now República de Colombia, has maintained that this
royal order made a new territorial division between
the capitanía general of Guatemala and the vireinato
of Nueva Granada; and to the latter belongs all the
territory alluded to in the royal order, and that said
territory was recognized as hers by the Gual-Molina
treaty. On behalf of Costa Rica, it has been alleged
that the Spanish crown never made a territorial
division with a mere royal order. The division of
provinces, vice-royalties, and captain-generalcies was
effected under a pragmatic sanction, a royal decree,
or a royal cédula. The royal order aforesaid made
no division of territory, but merely placed San Andrés
and the Mosquito Coast under the care of the viceroy
at Bogotá because Spain at that time had military
and naval resources at Cartagena. Nevertheless the
order had no effect; it became a dead letter, the
viceroy never having protected that coast. Such was
the impression of the Central American negotiator
of the treaty of 1825.<a name='FA_XI-75' id='FA_XI-75' href='#FN_XI-75' class='fnanchor'>[XI-75]</a> With this same understanding
the federal government of Central America made a
contract in 1836 to settle an Irish colony in the region
of Boca del Toro,<a name='FA_XI-76' id='FA_XI-76' href='#FN_XI-76' class='fnanchor'>[XI-76]</a> which was not carried out because
the New Granadan authorities drove away the settlers,
and have ever since held control of the region, disregarding
Costa Rica's claims.<a name='FA_XI-77' id='FA_XI-77' href='#FN_XI-77' class='fnanchor'>[XI-77]</a>
</p>

<p>
Several diplomatic efforts were fruitlessly made to
fix the boundary.<a name='FA_XI-78' id='FA_XI-78' href='#FN_XI-78' class='fnanchor'>[XI-78]</a> The last one was made at San
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
José on the 25th of December, 1880, in the form of a
convention to refer the settlement of the question at
issue to the arbitration of a friendly power, namely,
the king of the Belgians or the king of Spain, and in
the event that neither of them could or would undertake
it, then the president of the Argentine confederation.<a name='FA_XI-79' id='FA_XI-79' href='#FN_XI-79' class='fnanchor'>[XI-79]</a>

<p>
The president's policy was one of repression by all

<p>
Little, if anything, has been said in this history of
the internal affairs of Nicaragua since 1838. Under
her first constitution, that of 1826, the chief executive
officer of the state was called jefe del estado, and his
term of office was for four years. The second organic
law, promulgated in 1838, gave that functionary the
title of director supremo, limiting his tenure of office
to two years. Pablo Buitrago seems to have been
the first director called upon to enforce the constitution
of 1838.<a name='FA_XII-1' id='FA_XII-1' href='#FN_XII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XII-1]</a> He was declared by the chambers, on
the 4th of March, 1841, to have been constitutionally
chosen. His first step was to remove from the office
of ministro general Francisco Castellon, who held it
ad interim under appointment by Patricio Rivas,<a name='FA_XII-2' id='FA_XII-2' href='#FN_XII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XII-2]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
calling to succeed him Simon Orozco, whom he could
more easily control.

<p class="sidenote">

</p>

<p>
Buitrago treated a communication from Morazan,
sent him from San Miguel, with contumely; and afterward,
when the ex-president, as jefe of Costa Rica,
accredited near him two commissioners, he declined
to receive them.<a name='FA_XII-3' id='FA_XII-3' href='#FN_XII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XII-3]</a> His course won him commendation
from the rulers of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XII-4' id='FA_XII-4' href='#FN_XII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XII-4]</a> His term of office
came to an end on the 1st of April, 1843, and he was
temporarily succeeded by Juan de Dios Orozco. The
official press asserted that the election for director had
been made with perfect freedom. But no candidate
having received the requisite number of votes, the
assembly chose Manuel Perez to fill the position.<a name='FA_XII-5' id='FA_XII-5' href='#FN_XII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XII-5]</a>
The state was at peace,<a name='FA_XII-6' id='FA_XII-6' href='#FN_XII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XII-6]</a> but was not to enjoy that
benefit long. In a previous chapter I have spoken of
the desolating war waged within her borders by the
tyrants of Salvador and Honduras. She was, moreover,
harassed by the intemperate demands for British
claimants made by Chatfield, the ally of the
aristocrats of Guatemala, who went so far as to dictate
to Nicaragua how to recognize and pay these
claims.<a name='FA_XII-7' id='FA_XII-7' href='#FN_XII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XII-7]</a> The assembly then authorized the executive
to arrange the matter in the best way possible, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
Castellon, the ministro general, proposed to Chatfield
to submit the disputed claims to arbitration, naming
Bishop Viteri as the Nicaraguan arbitrator. Finally,
a legation was despatched to London, Castellon being
the minister and Máximo Jerez the secretary.<a name='FA_XII-8' id='FA_XII-8' href='#FN_XII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XII-8]</a> The
British authorities resolved, however, to use coercion
in order to force a settlement of the claims, the corvette
<i>Daphne</i> blockading the port of Realejo in August
1846; and the government, being without funds
to meet such demands at once, had to pledge the revenue
from the tobacco monopoly during the next four
years.
</p>

<p>
Leon, after its terrible conflict with the forces of
Salvador and Honduras, aided by Nicaraguan allies,
was in a shattered condition, and most of the families
dwelling therein were in mourning, and reduced to
indigence. Muñoz, who so efficiently coöperated to
that result, had secured the coveted reward, the command
in chief of the western department. The seat
of government was at San Fernando, and Blas Antonio
Saenz assumed the executive duties on the 20th
of January, 1845.<a name='FA_XII-9' id='FA_XII-9' href='#FN_XII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XII-9]</a> Under the sword of Muñoz the
elections for director supremo were effected, and José
Leon Sandoval obtained a plurality vote.<a name='FA_XII-10' id='FA_XII-10' href='#FN_XII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XII-10]</a> He was

REVOLUTION UPON REVOLUTION.
</p>

<p>
Peace had not been restored. Disturbances were
breaking out in several parts. There were revolutionary
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_241' name='Page_241' href='#Page_241'>241</a></span>
movements in Managua, and the government
sent thither Ponciano Corral to make an investigation,
and quell the sedition. His report brought
about the imprisonment of several citizens.<a name='FA_XII-12' id='FA_XII-12' href='#FN_XII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XII-12]</a> Manifestations
in favor of Cabañas at Rivas were put down
with an iron hand. On the 24th of June there was a
revolt at Leon, which Muñoz quelled, and the government
had its authors confined in San Juan del Norte.<a name='FA_XII-13' id='FA_XII-13' href='#FN_XII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XII-13]</a>
The executive had proclaimed neutrality in the contest
between the government of Salvador and Malespin,
who was sustained by Honduras; and though he
concluded with Salvador at San Fernando a treaty of
peace, friendship, and alliance, he also entered into a
similar one with Honduras.<a name='FA_XII-14' id='FA_XII-14' href='#FN_XII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XII-14]</a> The latter treaty was
intended to be a reality, and it is undeniable that Nicaragua
was a faithful ally and coöperator of Honduras
down to the treaty of Sensenti. The treaty with
Salvador was not made in good faith on the part of
Nicaragua.

<p>
The town of Chinandega was, in the latter part of
July, captured by 200 revolutionists under José M.
Valle, alias El Chelon,<a name='FA_XII-15' id='FA_XII-15' href='#FN_XII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XII-15]</a> who had come with sixty or
eighty men on a schooner from La Union, and landed
at Cosigüina.<a name='FA_XII-16' id='FA_XII-16' href='#FN_XII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XII-16]</a> On the 26th Muñoz was attacked in
Leon, but defeated his assailants.<a name='FA_XII-17' id='FA_XII-17' href='#FN_XII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XII-17]</a> The government
abandoned San Fernando and went to Managua.<a name='FA_XII-18' id='FA_XII-18' href='#FN_XII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XII-18]</a>

Muñoz, victorious again at Chichigalpa, marched on
Chinandega, which he occupied without opposition;
but having to return to Leon, the insurgents retook
it. He came back with a large force on the 16th of
August, and reoccupied the place.<a name='FA_XII-19' id='FA_XII-19' href='#FN_XII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XII-19]</a> Sandoval had,
on the 9th, forbidden the men who accompanied Morazan
to Costa Rica from entering Nicaraguan soil.
A ministerial crisis occurred at this time, Rocha and
César resigning their portfolios, which were given to
Máximo Jerez and Buitrago.<a name='FA_XII-20' id='FA_XII-20' href='#FN_XII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XII-20]</a> Their tenure was
necessarily short, and they were superseded in the
latter part of the year by Fruto Chamorro and José
Guerrero, the latter being almost immediately succeeded
by Lino César. This new arrangement gave
the director an homogeneous cabinet. The government
was now a decidedly conservative one.
</p>

<p>
The revolution came to an end in the latter part of
September 1845, an amnesty being issued excepting
only the chief leaders, and persons guilty of common
crimes.<a name='FA_XII-21' id='FA_XII-21' href='#FN_XII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XII-21]</a>

SANDOVAL AND MORALES.
</p>

<p>
This short truce enabled Sandoval to pay an official
visit to the several districts. In Chinandega the inhabitants
having abandoned their homes, he issued
orders to bring them back.<a name='FA_XII-22' id='FA_XII-22' href='#FN_XII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XII-22]</a> The government was
levying heavy taxes. The citizens of Leon, Chinandega,
El Viejo, and other places, who were the victims
of the self-styled "ejército protector de la paz," were
compelled to support the régime which had its being
out of the destruction of the first-named town. It is,
therefore, not a matter of surprise that the people of
many towns went off to the woods. The insurrection
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_243' name='Page_243' href='#Page_243'>243</a></span>
broke out again, Valle appearing in Segovia, and reëntering
Chinandega on the 26th of November. The
amnesty decree was thereupon revoked.<a name='FA_XII-23' id='FA_XII-23' href='#FN_XII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XII-23]</a> The state
of Honduras took part in the war, sending an army
under Guardiola to the aid of Sandoval. The insurgents
were defeated first by Muñoz, and soon after by
Guardiola, who occupied Chinandega.<a name='FA_XII-24' id='FA_XII-24' href='#FN_XII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XII-24]</a> At the end
of the campaign Muñoz signified a desire to leave the
state, and asked for a passport; but the government
replied with words of fulsome praise that his services
could not be spared.<a name='FA_XII-25' id='FA_XII-25' href='#FN_XII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XII-25]</a> This was precisely what Muñoz
had fished for.<a name='FA_XII-26' id='FA_XII-26' href='#FN_XII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XII-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
Efforts were made by Buitrago and others to prevail
on Sandoval to call the chambers of 1846 to sit
in Leon, but he objected to the proposition. The
assembly met first in San Fernando June 7, 1846, and
on the 14th of August sanctioned every past act of the
government.<a name='FA_XII-27' id='FA_XII-27' href='#FN_XII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XII-27]</a> At a later date it removed to Managua,
and adjourned leaving much unfinished business,
for which it was summoned to an extra session,<a name='FA_XII-28' id='FA_XII-28' href='#FN_XII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XII-28]</a> and
after doing what was required of it, retired on the 18th
of December.
</p>

<p>
The end of Sandoval's term was approaching, and
elections for supremo director took place. The assembly
met again on the 12th of March, 1847, and
Senator Miguel R. Morales assumed the executive.
Minister Salinas in his annual report made a number
of suggestions to the chambers; namely, an amendment
of the constitution in the direction styled by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
conservatives, "moderado y de órden;" good relations
with the pope, and cordial friendship with the priests;
public instruction based upon the requirements of the
council of Trent. The office of supremo director
passed, on the 6th of April, into the hands of José
Guerrero, who had been chosen for the constitutional
term.<a name='FA_XII-29' id='FA_XII-29' href='#FN_XII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XII-29]</a> Acceding to the repeated petitions of the people
of the western department, Guerrero decreed<a name='FA_XII-30' id='FA_XII-30' href='#FN_XII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XII-30]</a> to
make Leon the residence of the government, and the
transfer was effected July 20th, the people of that city
greeting the director and his officials with joy. The
assembly, however, preferred to sit at Managua, and
did so on the 3d of September.<a name='FA_XII-31' id='FA_XII-31' href='#FN_XII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XII-31]</a>
</p>

<p>
The country stood in need of a new constitution,
but this could not be framed at the present time, because
the whole attention of the government and
people was absorbed by the questions with Great
Britain, which were a menace to Nicaraguan territory,
and even to the independence of all Central
America. These difficulties were connected with the
possession of the territory known as the Mosquito
Coast, or Mosquitia. The Spanish authorities to the
last moment of their rule over Central America acted
in a manner indicative of Spain's claim of full sovereignty
over that territory, disallowing the pretended
right of the Zambo chief who under British protection
had been dubbed King of Mosquitia.<a name='FA_XII-32' id='FA_XII-32' href='#FN_XII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XII-32]</a>

KING GEORGE FREDERICK.
</p>

<p>
George Frederick and his half-brother Robert, like
their father George, who was killed in 1800, were of
mixed negro and Indian blood. They were first taken
to Belize to receive some education,<a name='FA_XII-36' id='FA_XII-36' href='#FN_XII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XII-36]</a> and next to
Jamaica, where they were the objects of some attention
on the part of Lord Albemarle, the governor-general.
George Frederick's education was an indifferent
one. In 1815 he was back in Belize to be crowned
there at his own request, Chaplain Armstrong performing
the ceremony, and his chiefs taking the oath
of allegiance in regular form.<a name='FA_XII-37' id='FA_XII-37' href='#FN_XII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XII-37]</a> He was then proclaimed
king of the Mosquito shore and nation, and a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
British war vessel conveyed him and his chiefs to
Gracias á Dios.<a name='FA_XII-38' id='FA_XII-38' href='#FN_XII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XII-38]</a> It seems that kingly life afforded
him little or no satisfaction. Aware of his lack of
qualifications, and fully sensible that he could not
retrieve himself from vicious habits, especially from
the bottle, which soon controlled him, his heart failed
him, and his life became embittered.<a name='FA_XII-39' id='FA_XII-39' href='#FN_XII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XII-39]</a> The British
government at first manifested a friendly interest,
sending him presents, and Chaplain Armstrong his
advice; but the latter was disregarded by the king
and his chief minister, who often remarked that a
present of rum would be more welcome. The instruction
on government was beyond his understanding,
and looked on as falsehood. Such was the effect of
his West India education in civilization. It has been
asserted that he was murdered in 1824.<a name='FA_XII-40' id='FA_XII-40' href='#FN_XII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XII-40]</a> Robert,
his brother, succeeded, and was deposed, his successor
being James, descended from an older branch of the
family,<a name='FA_XII-41' id='FA_XII-41' href='#FN_XII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XII-41]</a> who took the name of George Frederick.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
Mosquito annals do not record what became of him.
The next king was Robert Charles Frederick, who
believing himself a real monarch, for and in consideration
of abundant contributions of rum, to which he
was much addicted, began to make large grants of
land, some of which carried with them the rights of
absolute sovereignty. Most of these grants were
afterward cancelled, and the king was taken by the
British authorities to Belize, and kept under control.
He died there, leaving, in a so-called last will, dated
in February 1840, to Superintendent Macdonald the
regency of his dominions during the minority of his
heir, the princess Inez Ann Frederick.<a name='FA_XII-42' id='FA_XII-42' href='#FN_XII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XII-42]</a> Macdonald,
whether as such regent or as an officer of the British
crown, appointed his private secretary, Patrick
Walker, to reside at Blewfields, and have charge of
the affairs of Mosquitia; since which time the shore began
to assume much importance, at least in a political
sense. Walker established a council of state, and
soon opened a dispute about boundaries with the
Central American states, giving rise to grave questions
which occupied the attention of other governments,
and of which I will treat later.

<p class="sidenote">COLONIZATION FAILURES.</p>

<p class="p2">
Several attempts were made since the early days
of the present century to colonize the Mosquito shore,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'>249</a></span>
for which large tracts of land were granted. Among
the most important was one made to the Scotchman
Sir Gregor MacGregor,<a name='FA_XII-43' id='FA_XII-43' href='#FN_XII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XII-43]</a> who soon after started a
wild project, which later was known as the Poyais
bubble, and ended, about 1823, disastrously for the
dupes who had been drawn into it.<a name='FA_XII-44' id='FA_XII-44' href='#FN_XII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XII-44]</a> In 1839 the
British Central America Land Company of London
made another experiment on the same place where
MacGregor had tried his, and it ended in failure.<a name='FA_XII-45' id='FA_XII-45' href='#FN_XII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XII-45]</a> A
German colony named Carlsruhe, near Blewfields,
which was started about 1844, had to be abandoned
in 1849 after losing about two thirds of the emigrants.
</p>

<p>
The climate of the coast is moist, hotter than in
the interior, and not as healthy. The greater part of
the soil is fertile, and it may be said that the country
possesses many natural elements of wealth.<a name='FA_XII-46' id='FA_XII-46' href='#FN_XII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XII-46]</a> Blewfields,
the capital of Mosquitia, is on the river and
lagoon of the same name. In the latter part of 1847
Blewfields and its dependencies had 599 inhabitants,
of which 111 were white and 488 black,<a name='FA_XII-47' id='FA_XII-47' href='#FN_XII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XII-47]</a> in two villages,
the larger, Blewfields, having 78 houses, and
the lesser, Carlsruhe, 16. Few of the houses were
built of boards. One of this kind was then occupied
by Walker, the British agent and consul-general, with
whom the sovereign resided.<a name='FA_XII-48' id='FA_XII-48' href='#FN_XII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XII-48]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
On the 12th of August, 1841, Macdonald, superintendent
of Belize, came to San Juan del Norte on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'>250</a></span>
frigate <i>Tweed</i>, bringing with him the so-called king
of the Mosquitos or Moscos. At the same time an
armed sloop, under the Mosquito flag and commanded
by Peter Shepherd, entered the port. The comandante
and revenue officer, Lieutenant-colonel Quijano,
went to see the commanding officers at Shepherd's
house, but was not received, on the plea that both
the king and superintendent were unwell. An official
letter from him was left unanswered. At last,
the superintendent's secretary, together with the captain
of the frigate and the king's secretary, called on
Quijano and told him that on the following day his
letter would be answered, requiring his recognition of
the Mosquito king as the ally of her Britannic Majesty.
Quijano refused, and his visitors retired. He
reiterated his refusal in a letter to the superintendent,
and in the name of his government solemnly protested
against his pretension, as well as against the
insults inflicted on his country.<a name='FA_XII-49' id='FA_XII-49' href='#FN_XII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XII-49]</a> He was finally notified

of the British officials at San Juan as high-handed,
accusing Macdonald of usurping the name of her
Britannic Majesty in supposing her to be an ally of
the so-called Mosquito king.<a name='FA_XII-52' id='FA_XII-52' href='#FN_XII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XII-52]</a> The whole American
continent became indignant at the British proceedings
in San Juan. There was one exception, however,
which must be classified as vile. Ferrera, jefe of
Honduras, under the influence of the servile element
of Guatemala, allied with Chatfield, recognized the
Mosquito nation.<a name='FA_XII-53' id='FA_XII-53' href='#FN_XII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XII-53]</a>

Chatfield informed Nicaragua that the whole Central

to the Mosquito king, without prejudice to other
rights the king might have south of the San Juan.<a name='FA_XII-54' id='FA_XII-54' href='#FN_XII-54' class='fnanchor'>[XII-54]</a>
In January 1848 two British war vessels occupied

the Nicaraguan officials by Englishmen as servants

away; but no sooner had the intelligence reached the
interior than a force was despatched to San Juan,
which reoccupied the place and sent to the capital as
prisoners the intruders.<a name='FA_XII-55' id='FA_XII-55' href='#FN_XII-55' class='fnanchor'>[XII-55]</a> Whereupon the British
returned in force in March 1848, and defeated the
Nicaraguan detachment. Hostilities being further
prosecuted, the Nicaraguans had to succumb before
the superior power of their foe, and consented to an
armistice, providing that they would not disturb San
Juan, or attempt to reoccupy the port, pending the
negotiations which must follow on these events.<a name='FA_XII-56' id='FA_XII-56' href='#FN_XII-56' class='fnanchor'>[XII-56]</a>

TREATIES.
</p>

<p>
Nicaragua, by her ablest diplomates, defended her
rights to the disputed territory both in Europe and
America, without obtaining a satisfactory result, until
the fears of Central Americans for the independence of
their country were brought to an end by the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty, otherwise called the Ship Canal convention,
concluded at Washington between the United
States and Great Britain on the 19th of April, 1850,
by the first article of which neither power could
occupy, fortify, colonize, nor exercise dominion over
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, the Mosquito Coast, or any
other portion of Central American territory, nor make
use of a protectorate in any form.<a name='FA_XII-57' id='FA_XII-57' href='#FN_XII-57' class='fnanchor'>[XII-57]</a> Thus was this
vexed question terminated, England resigning all her
claims to the Mosquito Coast, and by a subsequent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
treaty concluded at Managua on the 28th of January,
1860, known as the Zeledon-Wyke treaty, ceded to
Nicaragua the protectorate absolutely.<a name='FA_XII-58' id='FA_XII-58' href='#FN_XII-58' class='fnanchor'>[XII-58]</a> Since then
Nicaragua has subjected the Mosquito Coast to a prefecto.<a name='FA_XII-59' id='FA_XII-59' href='#FN_XII-59' class='fnanchor'>[XII-59]</a>
Nevertheless, it is understood that the Indian
reserve is still ruled by a chief chosen by the
natives, assisted by a council, which assembles at
Blewfields; but subject to the supreme authority of
the Nicaraguan government.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Nicaragua, as soon as she assumed the position of
an independent nation, hastened to open friendly
relations with other powers.<a name='FA_XII-60' id='FA_XII-60' href='#FN_XII-60' class='fnanchor'>[XII-60]</a> Spain made with the

</p>

<p>
With the other Central American states Nicaragua
made treaties, which underwent from time to time
alterations, as circumstances seemed to demand for
her own or the general defence. Several of these
will be made apparent in the course of my narrative.
Nicaragua has endeavored to maintain cordial relations
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
with her neighbors.<a name='FA_XII-63' id='FA_XII-63' href='#FN_XII-63' class='fnanchor'>[XII-63]</a> The republic entered into
friendly diplomatic relations with the powers of
Europe and America, most of them having treaties
of amity, commerce, and extradition of criminals. Its
relations with the United States have generally been
intimate, made so by considerations of neighborhood,
business interests, and similarity of institutions, as
well as by a mutual desire to forward the construction
of a ship canal across Nicaraguan territory. They
have been disturbed at times, however, while Nicaragua
was a transit route between the eastern states
of the American union, and during the execution of
schemes of American filibusters, such as those of
Kinney and Walker.

<p class="sidenote">
ARBITRARY ACTS.
</p>

<p>
While the Mosquito question was pending between
Nicaragua and Great Britain, circumstances were
hastening a practical solution of it. An American
company, acting under a Nicaraguan charter, opened a
transit route for passengers through the state, beginning
at San Juan del Norte, which place rapidly filled
up with emigrants from the United States, who becoming
numerically predominant, met in a primary
capacity and organized an independent government.<a name='FA_XII-64' id='FA_XII-64' href='#FN_XII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XII-64]</a>
After an indiscreet attempt on the part of a British
commander to levy duties on an American steamer,
which was disavowed by his government, the British
protectorate over San Juan at last virtually ceased.
The town and port remained under the direct control
of the inhabitants, most of whom were Americans, as
a free city.<a name='FA_XII-65' id='FA_XII-65' href='#FN_XII-65' class='fnanchor'>[XII-65]</a> The prosperity of the place was retarded
by a dispute with the persons into whose hands the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_255' name='Page_255' href='#Page_255'>255</a></span>
transit had fallen, which produced bitter feeling, and
resulted in alleged insults to Solon Borland, United
States minister to Nicaragua, whose belligerent instincts
carried him away to interfere in matters which
were foreign to his office. The sloop of war <i>Cyane</i>,
Commander Hollins, was despatched by the American
government to look into the case. Hollins assumed
a hostile attitude,<a name='FA_XII-66' id='FA_XII-66' href='#FN_XII-66' class='fnanchor'>[XII-66]</a> made arrogant demands, and the
latter not being complied with, he bombarded the
town on the 13th of July, 1854, and landing a party
of marines, burned it to the ground.<a name='FA_XII-67' id='FA_XII-67' href='#FN_XII-67' class='fnanchor'>[XII-67]</a> This act has
been generally condemned. The American government
hardly contemplated it; but not having punished
Commander Hollins, it must bear the odium.
Notwithstanding these difficulties, peaceable relations
were not disturbed.<a name='FA_XII-68' id='FA_XII-68' href='#FN_XII-68' class='fnanchor'>[XII-68]</a> Nicaragua also has treaties with
Belgium, Italy, France, England, Peru, and other
nations.<a name='FA_XII-69' id='FA_XII-69' href='#FN_XII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XII-69]</a>

A squabble occurred in 1876 at Leon, in which the
German consul and a Nicaraguan citizen were concerned,
giving rise to a conflict between the German
and Nicaraguan governments, the former making of it

a considerable sum of money.<a name='FA_XII-70' id='FA_XII-70' href='#FN_XII-70' class='fnanchor'>[XII-70]</a>

by José Laureano Pineda in 1851,<a name='FA_XII-73' id='FA_XII-73' href='#FN_XII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XII-73]</a> against whom a
revolt broke out August 4, 1851, having J. Trinidad
Muñoz for its leader. Pineda and his ministers Francisco
Castellon and F. Diaz Zapata were arrested.
The plan failed, however. Leon, Muñoz' headquarters,
was taken by government forces assisted by
troops from Honduras, and Muñoz surrendered.<a name='FA_XII-74' id='FA_XII-74' href='#FN_XII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XII-74]</a> On
the expiration of Pineda's term in 1853, Chamorro
became chief of the state, having been elected by the
suffrages of the moderados. The new director was a

well-meaning man, and hoped by pursuing a moderate
course to allay party bickerings. But his political
opponents, together with a portion of the military
element, did not permit him to develop his policy in
peace.

The legislative assembly rejected, April 30, 1853, a

13th of October, 1852,<a name='FA_XII-75' id='FA_XII-75' href='#FN_XII-75' class='fnanchor'>[XII-75]</a> and at the same time declared
the state to be independent and sovereign. This was
followed on the 28th of February, 1854, by another
decree of the state constituent assembly assuming for
the state the title of República de Nicaragua, and giving
its executive the name of president.<a name='FA_XII-76' id='FA_XII-76' href='#FN_XII-76' class='fnanchor'>[XII-76]</a> The coat

CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY.

<p>
A constituent assembly, called on the 11th of December,
1853, to meet on the 8th of January, 1854,
for the purpose of framing a constitution for the
republic, was installed on the 22d of that month.<a name='FA_XII-78' id='FA_XII-78' href='#FN_XII-78' class='fnanchor'>[XII-78]</a>

April,<a name='FA_XII-79' id='FA_XII-79' href='#FN_XII-79' class='fnanchor'>[XII-79]</a> which was in force only in Granada and other

LONG AND BLOODY WAR.
</p>

<p>
The opposition of the liberals culminated in an attempt
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_259' name='Page_259' href='#Page_259'>259</a></span>
at revolution in Leon, promoted by Castellon,
Jerez, and Mariano Salazar. The government then
residing at Managua defeated their plan for the time,
and banished the leaders and a few of their influential
followers.<a name='FA_XII-80' id='FA_XII-80' href='#FN_XII-80' class='fnanchor'>[XII-80]</a> The exiles sought refuge in Salvador and
Honduras, and with the favor of Cabañas, who
was then on bad terms with Chamorro,<a name='FA_XII-81' id='FA_XII-81' href='#FN_XII-81' class='fnanchor'>[XII-81]</a> obtained resources
for a second attempt against the government
of the latter. With a few men and a quantity of
arms and ammunition, they went from Tigre Island
to Realejo. The invaders were enthusiastically received,
Leon, Chinandega, and immediate towns proclaiming
Castellon provisional director, which office
he assumed June 11, 1854.<a name='FA_XII-82' id='FA_XII-82' href='#FN_XII-82' class='fnanchor'>[XII-82]</a> This was the beginning
of a long and bloody war, which Salvador and Guatemala
vainly tried to avert.<a name='FA_XII-83' id='FA_XII-83' href='#FN_XII-83' class='fnanchor'>[XII-83]</a> Chamorro approached
Leon, but finding it had declared for Castellon, retired
to Granada and fortified the place, sustaining afterward
an irregular siege of several months from thrice the
number of his force, under Jerez, till the early part of
1855. Castellon, meantime, gained possession of the
republic, Granada excepted; but the long siege of this
town wrought a change in the feelings of the unstable
people, and in a short time Chamorro or his party recovered
Managua, Masaya, and Rivas, after a series
of bloody encounters. The siege of Granada was consequently
raised.<a name='FA_XII-84' id='FA_XII-84' href='#FN_XII-84' class='fnanchor'>[XII-84]</a> Even Chamorro's death, which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_260' name='Page_260' href='#Page_260'>260</a></span>
occurred at this time,<a name='FA_XII-85' id='FA_XII-85' href='#FN_XII-85' class='fnanchor'>[XII-85]</a> did not favor the democrats.
He was succeeded by José María Estrada. Corral
was the general-in-chief of the legitimist forces, and
was organizing at Masaya an army to capture Leon.
The government had called the constituent assembly,
which met on the 8th of April with only fourteen
members, and on the 10th resolved that Estrada
should retain the executive until a president should
be chosen under the constitution. This greatly displeased
Corral, who had expected to be called to that
position. He had his headquarters in Managua, and
threatened to be revenged of the men who had slighted
him.<a name='FA_XII-86' id='FA_XII-86' href='#FN_XII-86' class='fnanchor'>[XII-86]</a>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Muñoz had gone to Honduras and returned
with a small division of troops, the chief command
of both the democratic and Honduran forces
being vested in him. By his advice Castellon appointed
Rosalío Cortés and P. Aleman commissioners
to ascertain the views of the legitimist chiefs with
reference to peace negotiations. Estrada consented
to receive Cortés, but not Aleman, and the former had
interviews with him and his supporters, prevailing on
them to enter into negotiations either in their official
or private capacity. Muñoz had authorized Cortés
to tell Corral he wished to have a direct understanding
with him.<a name='FA_XII-87' id='FA_XII-87' href='#FN_XII-87' class='fnanchor'>[XII-87]</a> Cortés first saw Corral, and by his
advice next had interviews with Estrada, Vega, and
others, all of whom showed a willingness to treat for
peace, and asked him to return to Leon, which he
did, touching at Managua, where Corral assured him
of his disposition to come to an understanding with
Muñoz.

DEMOCRATS AND LEGITIMISTS.
</p>

<p>
The situation of the democrats was improved since
the return of Muñoz. That of the legitimists was
not so good, but the rulers felt confident. By its
moderate course the legitimist government was gaining
favor in democratic towns. Estrada's confidence
was increased with the arrival of two foreign ministers
accredited to his government.<a name='FA_XII-88' id='FA_XII-88' href='#FN_XII-88' class='fnanchor'>[XII-88]</a> By this time
Corral had an efficient division at Managua. His
subordinate, Colonel Tomás Martinez, who in late
years became president of the republic, not only
cleared Nueva Segovia of Hondurans, but also occupied
the town of San Márcos in Honduras. Lieutenant-colonel
Andrés Murillo obtained a victory over
the democrats at Tecuaname on the 17th of May.
A few days after—May 31st—Estrada's government
decreed an amnesty to all soldiers, from private
to sergeant inclusive, presenting themselves within
twenty days.<a name='FA_XII-89' id='FA_XII-89' href='#FN_XII-89' class='fnanchor'>[XII-89]</a> On the 13th of June came two men
who afterward were fatal to the legitimists, Santos
Guardiola, and the clergyman Manuel Alcaine. The
latter was a commissioner from Salvador to both belligerents,
and his efforts on behalf of peace had been
favorably entertained by Castellon. Estrada listened
to him, but did not accept his proposals.<a name='FA_XII-90' id='FA_XII-90' href='#FN_XII-90' class='fnanchor'>[XII-90]</a> Alcaine
went back to Leon, and reported that the legitimists
were bent upon exterminating the democrats, and his
statements were fully believed. All hope of bringing
the war to an end by peaceful negotiations was
now abandoned.<a name='FA_XII-91' id='FA_XII-91' href='#FN_XII-91' class='fnanchor'>[XII-91]</a>

<p class="sidenote">REIGN OF DESPOTISM.
</p>

<p>
Carrera had become so inflated by flattery that he
actually believed himself able to govern upon instinct
Guatemala, and even all Central America.<a name='FA_XIII-1' id='FA_XIII-1' href='#FN_XIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-1]</a> He tried
to shake off aristocratic control, and showed pugnaciousness
toward the assembly and the administrator
of the diocese. Obedience not being in every instance
given to his whims, he threatened, in August 1840, to
resign the command of the troops, which he held with
the rank of lieutenant-general.<a name='FA_XIII-2' id='FA_XIII-2' href='#FN_XIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-2]</a> The aristocrats were
much alarmed, and the assembly, in flattering terms,
declined accepting the resignation. He now appeared
in the rôles of financier, political economist, and enemy
of the nobles, presuming to dictate a policy for the
protection of manufactures, agriculture, and other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
interests. His displeasure with the nobles was because
he believed them hostile to the masses.<a name='FA_XIII-3' id='FA_XIII-3' href='#FN_XIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-3]</a> They
managed to mollify him, and he then contented himself
with issuing a long address, on the 9th of October,
reiterating his anxiety for the general welfare, and
remonstrating against the intrigues of his personal
enemies.<a name='FA_XIII-4' id='FA_XIII-4' href='#FN_XIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-4]</a>
</p>

<p>
A reign of despotism was now established, which
continued upwards of thirty years. Liberal laws were
abrogated one after another, and retrogressive ones
substituted, including a complete restoration to the
clergy of the fueros they had been deprived of by the
liberal córtes of Spain in 1820. Carrera's enmity to
the assembly became more apparent from day to day.
He showed it by word, and by the press.<a name='FA_XIII-5' id='FA_XIII-5' href='#FN_XIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-5]</a> He could
not write a line, but others wrote for him, and printed
articles appeared over his name.<a name='FA_XIII-6' id='FA_XIII-6' href='#FN_XIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-6]</a> José Francisco
Barrundia had returned from his exile, and had been
chosen a deputy, but he resigned on the 11th of March,
1842, giving powerful reasons for his course.<a name='FA_XIII-7' id='FA_XIII-7' href='#FN_XIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-7]</a> Indeed,
Barrundia would have been out of place in a body
mostly made up of ultramontane priests, self-styled
nobles, and reactionists.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The treasury was so exhausted that the assembly
had no means to pay its clerks. But the ecclesiastical
coffers had an abundance of money from the tithes
tax, and Carrera's troops had to be paid, or he would
resent the neglect. This was made evident in September
1844. Rivera Paz, the president, with the
utmost difficulties, managed to procure money for the
pay of the soldiers from day to day; but for some
reason unexplained, it did not reach them. Carrera
found a way to secure his ends. He had a conference
with some of his officers, and the result was that the
battalion of regular troops revolted on the 20th, and
sacked a number of shops, and the stalls in the market-place,
getting an abundant supply and ruining several
traders.<a name='FA_XIII-8' id='FA_XIII-8' href='#FN_XIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-8]</a> Carrera then gathered his soldiers in the
barracks, and in order to keep up appearances, the
next day without much ado or any form of trial, had
six men shot.<a name='FA_XIII-9' id='FA_XIII-9' href='#FN_XIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-9]</a>
</p>

<p>
Rivera Paz, finding his position unbearable, resigned
it. The assembly accepted his resignation, to take
effect after his successor should be appointed, and
qualify. Carrera was chosen, but declined the office.
Venancio Lopez and Bernardino Lemus, appointed in
the order named, followed his example. Rivera Paz
had to remain as nominal head of the government,
Carrera being the actual ruler, whose demands clashed
with the fiery-tempered Viteri, minister of state.
They had a serious quarrel, which culminated in the
arrest by Carrera, on the 7th of December, 1841, of
Rivera Paz, together with Viteri and his subordinates.<a name='FA_XIII-10' id='FA_XIII-10' href='#FN_XIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-10]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_267' name='Page_267' href='#Page_267'>267</a></span>
But after explanations he retired his force, and calm
was restored. On the refusal of Carrera to accept
the presidency resigned by Rivera Paz, December 14,
1841, the councillor Venancio Lopez was called upon
to assume the office.<a name='FA_XIII-11' id='FA_XIII-11' href='#FN_XIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-11]</a> The lieutenant-general asked
for a passport to leave Guatemala, his object being
only to obtain more honors and money. His plan
seems to have succeeded.<a name='FA_XIII-12' id='FA_XIII-12' href='#FN_XIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-12]</a> Lopez gave up the presidency,
and Rivera Paz for the third time, on the 14th
of May, 1842, was appointed to fill it.

<p class="sidenote">
SANGUINARY POLITICS.
</p>

<p>
The assembly adjourned on the 4th of November,
1843, to meet again on the 1st of April, 1844. But
Carrera had resolved to suppress it, and pretending
an intended seditious movement at Pinula, he had
the supposed rebels fired upon, and the criminal farce
ended with a simulated capitulation at Guadalupe on
the 11th of March, 1844, by which the assembly was
set aside, and a council of government was to take its
place.<a name='FA_XIII-13' id='FA_XIII-13' href='#FN_XIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-13]</a> The assembly was convoked, ratified its own
dishonor, gave the government full power to regulate
administrative affairs, and decreed its own dissolution.<a name='FA_XIII-14' id='FA_XIII-14' href='#FN_XIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-14]</a>
The decree convoking members for the new
council<a name='FA_XIII-15' id='FA_XIII-15' href='#FN_XIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-15]</a> was issued on the 26th of April, and it was
formally installed on the 8th of December, having
among its members a number of liberals. Rivera Paz
resigned the presidency,<a name='FA_XIII-16' id='FA_XIII-16' href='#FN_XIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-16]</a> and Carrera was chosen his
successor, assuming on the 11th of December an office
that he had virtually controlled since the 13th of
April, 1839. At the election of justices of the supreme
court, the nobles were defeated.<a name='FA_XIII-17' id='FA_XIII-17' href='#FN_XIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-17]</a> The consejo, or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
congreso, as it had begun to call itself, became an object
of bitter enmity on the part of the aristocrats and
serviles; and Carrera's overthrow was also contemplated
by them, pretending coöperation with the liberals
for its accomplishment. The plan fell through
before maturity, owing to distrust between the leaders
of the two parties. Carrera was informed of his
danger by the confession of a dying man, but never
penetrated to the sources of the plot.<a name='FA_XIII-18' id='FA_XIII-18' href='#FN_XIII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-18]</a> During Carrera's
absence from the capital on furlough in February
1845, Joaquin Duran occupying the executive
chair, a revolt took place, headed by Monterrosa and
an officer named Mendez, but not being seconded by
the people, they entered into a capitulation with Duran
to leave the city, on his solemnly pledging them that
they would not be molested. They accordingly went
out on the 5th as promised, and on the next day
Sotero Carrera, A. Solares, and Vicente Cruz entered
at the head of their respective forces. Carrera arrived
afterward, and was received in triumph.<a name='FA_XIII-19' id='FA_XIII-19' href='#FN_XIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-19]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
CONSTITUTION AND CONGRESS.
</p>

<p>
At the expiration of his furlough Carrera reassumed
the reins of government. Joaquin Duran resigned
the portfolio of treasury and war, being succeeded by
Brigadier Gerónimo Paiz. The state was now virtually
under the control of a triumvirate composed of Rafael
and Sotero Carrera, and Paiz.<a name='FA_XIII-20' id='FA_XIII-20' href='#FN_XIII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-20]</a> The subsequent resignation
of Minister Nájera and appointment of José
Antonio Azmitia inspired a little confidence.<a name='FA_XIII-21' id='FA_XIII-21' href='#FN_XIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-21]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'>269</a></span>
constituent congress passed liberal laws, and issued a
new constitution on the 16th of September, 1845, that
did not suit the aristocrats, and they made it an object
of ridicule and contempt.<a name='FA_XIII-22' id='FA_XIII-22' href='#FN_XIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-22]</a> The congress closed
its session on the 21st of the same month. Carrera
had obtained another leave of absence, and Brigadier
Vicente Cruz, the vice-president chosen by congress,
assumed the executive office.<a name='FA_XIII-23' id='FA_XIII-23' href='#FN_XIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-23]</a> The aristocrats kept
a strict watch on Cruz, and breathed more freely when
Carrera with his ministers Paiz and Azmitia were
again at the head of the government. The succeeding
congress on the 1st of February, 1846, rejected
the constitution framed the previous year, and authorized
the government to call another constituent congress.
This was the result, not only of aristocratic
intrigue, but of violent threats on the part of Carrera
and his minions against all attempting to sanction
the act of the '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">desorganizadores</span>' to undermine his
power.<a name='FA_XIII-24' id='FA_XIII-24' href='#FN_XIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-24]</a>
</p>

<p>
Carrera and Paiz, aided by Sotero Carrera, corregidor
of La Antigua, now ruled supreme. Citizens
had no protection unless they approved of every act.
During the funeral services of Archbishop Casaus a
plot was made to assassinate Carrera, which failed,
and the conspirators were seized and tried. Those who
had powerful friends were sent into exile; the rest had
to perish in the damp dungeons of the fort.<a name='FA_XIII-25' id='FA_XIII-25' href='#FN_XIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-25]</a>

<p class="p2">
Guatemala, in view of the political change resulting
from the dissolution of the federal compact, decreed
by her assembly, on the 14th of November, 1843, a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'>270</a></span>
new coat of arms for the state.<a name='FA_XIII-26' id='FA_XIII-26' href='#FN_XIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-26]</a> On the 6th of April,
1857, the government was empowered to make in the
coat of arms such changes as it might deem judicious,
but preserving the inscription, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Guatimalæ Respublica
sub Dei Optimi Maximi protectione</span>. The change
was decreed on the 31st of May, 1858.<a name='FA_XIII-27' id='FA_XIII-27' href='#FN_XIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-27]</a> A law of

The national independence of Guatemala was erelong
recognized by foreign powers, with which she
opened diplomatic relations and made treaties.<a name='FA_XIII-29' id='FA_XIII-29' href='#FN_XIII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-29]</a> The
formal recognition by Spain took place in the treaty
of May 29, 1863, subsequently ratified by both governments.
Guatemala has endeavored to maintain
friendly relations with all. With the United States
they have been quite cordial. During Carrera's rule
his government gave recognition to the imperial régime
of Maximilian in Mexico.<a name='FA_XIII-30' id='FA_XIII-30' href='#FN_XIII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-30]</a> During the South
American struggle between Chile on one side, and
Peru and Bolivia on the other, Guatemala maintained
herself neutral. She accepted in 1881 the invitation
of the United States government to be represented
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
at a proposed American congress to be held in Washington,
but which did not take place. In that same
year, owing to the maltreatment of a French citizen,
a difficulty arose with France, but it was amicably
settled, the French flag being saluted, and a pecuniary
compensation allowed by Guatemala.<a name='FA_XIII-31' id='FA_XIII-31' href='#FN_XIII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-31]</a>

<p class="sidenote">REVOLUTION AND ROBBERY.</p>

<p class="p2">
On the 8th of April the official journal gave to the
public a decree appointing Pedro Molina, Alejandro

constitution for the new republic,<a name='FA_XIII-32' id='FA_XIII-32' href='#FN_XIII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-32]</a> a project of which

nobles were delighted with their republic, and made
it appear in the official paper that the people in the

attributed by many to the contrivances of
monopolists, created disturbances in some districts,
alarming the government. Certain taxes were temporarily
removed, and other measures were adopted
to alleviate the distress.<a name='FA_XIII-34' id='FA_XIII-34' href='#FN_XIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-34]</a>

In May there was a revolutionary movement in
Sacatepequez.<a name='FA_XIII-35' id='FA_XIII-35' href='#FN_XIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-35]</a> Robbery and murder became of frequent
occurrence in several departments. The government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>

efforts to meet it. It tried, however, to show that
the public peace was not disturbed.<a name='FA_XIII-36' id='FA_XIII-36' href='#FN_XIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-36]</a> All measures
to check the revolution were unavailing, and the policy
of the rulers of Salvador made the condition of
affairs more alarming to Carrera and his supporters.
Their political opponents now thought the overthrow
of the tyrant was not far distant. His counsellors
advised him to call a constituent congress, and provisionally
place the executive office in the hands of
Vice-president Cruz, to which he acceded. The decree
for summoning the congress was issued, and Cruz
assumed the presidency on the 25th of January.<a name='FA_XIII-37' id='FA_XIII-37' href='#FN_XIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-37]</a>
Nájera and Azmitia retired, which indicated a change
of policy. This greatly exercised the reactionists,
and the ayuntamiento of Guatemala, on the 4th of

office, whereupon Cruz threw it up, and the former
took the chair at once. He organized a new cabinet,<a name='FA_XIII-38' id='FA_XIII-38' href='#FN_XIII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-38]</a>
the personnel of which was a challenge to the
whole liberal party, which thereby was roused to
action. The first act of the government was to revoke
the decree calling the constituent assembly. All hope
of reform was now given up.

The revolution went on, and notwithstanding occasional
reverses made much headway, Serapio Cruz, a
brother of the vice-president, and an estimable man and
experienced soldier, taking sides with the mountaineers.
The government was sinking under the weight of its
depravity; and yet in those moments of despair, it
struck a blow at its opponents. Molina was arrested
on the 10th of May. A similar order was issued
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
against Barrundia, but he escaped the clutches of the
sbirri, first giving the government his mind in the
<i>Album</i>, which publication was of course suppressed.<a name='FA_XIII-39' id='FA_XIII-39' href='#FN_XIII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-39]</a>
Together with Molina were conveyed to the fort José
Marino Vidaurre and the printer Luciano Luna. An
order of the court of first instance, issued at the petition
of Molina's wife, was treated with contempt by
Palomo Valdez, acting comandante of the department,
who merely said that Molina had been imprisoned
upon a verbal order of the president. The prisoners,
were released after some time of suffering in the dungeons
of the fort. The <i>Gaceta</i> repeatedly contained
abusive remarks against the republicans of France,
The French consul demanded a retraction, and not
being heeded, struck his flag and discontinued relations

POLITICAL UNREST.

<p>
The position of the government was daily becoming
more untenable, when it concluded to call a constituent
assembly, to begin its labors on the 15th of
August.<a name='FA_XIII-41' id='FA_XIII-41' href='#FN_XIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-41]</a> A scandalous occurrence took place a few
days before the installation of the assembly, when the

</p>

<p>
Carrera made known his intention to resign<a name='FA_XIII-42' id='FA_XIII-42' href='#FN_XIII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-42]</a> on
the installation of the assembly, and the insurgent
chief Francisco Carrillo tendered his submission to
that body. The liberals could not expect to elect any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
candidate of their own, and the reactionists, though
having a working majority in the assembly, from
motives of policy abstained from presenting one of
their party; but they finally fixed upon a political
nonentity, who was known to be in accord with Nufio
and the revolutionists of Chiquimula, named Juan
Antonio Martinez,<a name='FA_XIII-43' id='FA_XIII-43' href='#FN_XIII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-43]</a> believing that though a liberal
he would not be antagonistic to their interests. The
assembly was installed on the 15th of August with
Pedro Molina presiding, when Carrera sent in three
documents, one of which was his resignation,<a name='FA_XIII-44' id='FA_XIII-44' href='#FN_XIII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-44]</a> which
was accepted, no attempt being made to detain him,
as it was the general desire that he should leave the

they made known their demands, dated August 27th,
in 18 articles.<a name='FA_XIII-49' id='FA_XIII-49' href='#FN_XIII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-49]</a> The government rejected them, but
in a decree requiring their submission offered certain

POLITICAL PARTIES.

<p>
Colonel Nufio had made an arrangement with commissioners
Dueñas and Angulo of Salvador for the
organization of Los Altos as a separate state. This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
roused the aristocrats, and their spokesman, Andreu,
made such broad statements in the chamber that the
president accused him of falsehood, and closed the
discussion. The affair widened the breach among
the liberals. Luis Molina now organized a third party,
that took the name of moderado, most of whose members
were from the liberal party and the latter was
left an almost insignificant minority. The aristocratic
party, albeit divided in appearance, was really united.<a name='FA_XIII-50' id='FA_XIII-50' href='#FN_XIII-50' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-50]</a>
They were disquieted, however, by the attitude of
Salvador in upholding the independence of Los Altos,
which had been organized as a state;<a name='FA_XIII-51' id='FA_XIII-51' href='#FN_XIII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-51]</a> but did not
despair of breaking up the friendship between the
liberals and the government of Salvador.<a name='FA_XIII-52' id='FA_XIII-52' href='#FN_XIII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-52]</a> The aristocrats
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
set themselves to work to have a motion made
by a liberal in the assembly for the confirmation of
Carrera's decree of March 21, 1847, to create the republic
of Guatemala. Such an act on the part of the
liberals would alienate from them the support of the
Salvadorans, and reduce them to a nullity. And yet
Barrundia made the motion,<a name='FA_XIII-53' id='FA_XIII-53' href='#FN_XIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-53]</a> and it was received with
a shout of applause, and passed on the 14th of September,
with only two negative votes.<a name='FA_XIII-54' id='FA_XIII-54' href='#FN_XIII-54' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-54]</a> This ratification
was hailed with ringing of bells and salvos of

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>

was accepted, with marked disrespect on the part of
the serviles and moderados.<a name='FA_XIII-61' id='FA_XIII-61' href='#FN_XIII-61' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-61]</a> Manuel Tejada was
chosen president on the 30th of December, and declined
the honor. Mariano Paredes was then appointed,
on the 1st of January, 1849, and took the
oath which had been prepared by Paredes, but he soon
perjured himself, following explicitly the advice of
Luis Batres, and thus becoming a tool of the aristocrats
to bring back Carrera to power.<a name='FA_XIII-62' id='FA_XIII-62' href='#FN_XIII-62' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-62]</a> Arrangements
were made with the mountaineers, under which Brigadier
Vicente Cruz, having recognized the government,
entered Guatemala on the 9th of February.<a name='FA_XIII-63' id='FA_XIII-63' href='#FN_XIII-63' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-63]</a>
It was noticed, however, that Serapio Cruz and other
chiefs remained outside. The men of Agustin Perez
afterward committed several murders, and Vicente
Cruz went against and defeated them on the 20th of
March, but while engaged in the pursuit was struck
by a bullet in the chest and fell dead.<a name='FA_XIII-64' id='FA_XIII-64' href='#FN_XIII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-64]</a>
</p>

<p>
Carrera was known to be on the frontier, and
Batres undertook to obtain the assent of the chiefs
of the mountain for his return. Not all of them
assented, however, Serapio Cruz issuing a very significant
manifesto. General Agustin Guzman, the
loyal liberal leader, well understood Batres' aims, and
having a force at Huehuetenango made a move on
Quezaltenango, defeating a large party of Indians, on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
the way, at San Bartolome. This move further complicated
affairs, and Batres resolved to get rid of him
by subterfuge.<a name='FA_XIII-65' id='FA_XIII-65' href='#FN_XIII-65' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-65]</a> There were constant skirmishes on
the frontier, Carrera having under him a considerable
number of Indians.<a name='FA_XIII-66' id='FA_XIII-66' href='#FN_XIII-66' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-66]</a> He finally reached Quezaltenango,
and the assembly empowered the government
to institute measures for an active campaign.<a name='FA_XIII-67' id='FA_XIII-67' href='#FN_XIII-67' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-67]</a> On
the 13th of April, just ten years after the occupation of
Guatemala by Carrera, his second entry had been announced.
Paredes swore to defend the city against
Carrera,<a name='FA_XIII-68' id='FA_XIII-68' href='#FN_XIII-68' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-68]</a> which oath he never intended to keep.
Major Victor Zavala, corregidor and comandante of
Suchitepequez, made common cause with Carrera.<a name='FA_XIII-69' id='FA_XIII-69' href='#FN_XIII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-69]</a>
Paredes, by the advice of Luis Batres and against the
wishes of the liberal and moderado leaders, opened
negotiations with Carrera, which resulted in the submission
of the latter and his forces at Quezaltenango,
whereupon it was decreed that all hostilities against
him were to cease; the order forbidding his return
was revoked, his rank of lieutenant-general was restored,
and finally he was given the command-in-chief
of the army. The compact between the oligarchy and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
barbarism was consummated.<a name='FA_XIII-70' id='FA_XIII-70' href='#FN_XIII-70' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-70]</a> He assumed the command
on the 8th of August, and on that date and the

restoring peace and order, and assuring the people
that he was free from hatred.<a name='FA_XIII-71' id='FA_XIII-71' href='#FN_XIII-71' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-71]</a> But the work of
vengeance soon began. Efforts were made to convene
the assembly with the object in view of arresting the
liberal deputies who voted for Carrera's proscription
in 1848,<a name='FA_XIII-72' id='FA_XIII-72' href='#FN_XIII-72' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-72]</a> but many of them had fled, and only those
remaining were confined in the fort by Carrera's order
without remonstrance on the part of the president.
It is also said that some persons were shot. Such of
the prisoners as did not crave Carrera's pardon were
forced to leave the country.<a name='FA_XIII-73' id='FA_XIII-73' href='#FN_XIII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-73]</a>

THE WAR OF 1850.
</p>

<p>
The difference in the principles underlying the policy
of the rulers of Guatemala and Salvador, and the bitter
animosity existing between them, brought about a
war in 1850, in which Salvador, Honduras, and the
democrats of Nicaragua were allied against Guatemala.<a name='FA_XIII-74' id='FA_XIII-74' href='#FN_XIII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-74]</a>
President Vasconcelos invaded Guatemala,<a name='FA_XIII-75' id='FA_XIII-75' href='#FN_XIII-75' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-75]</a>

at the head of an allied force of Salvadorans, Hondurans,
and Nicaraguans, but seems to have met with a
signal defeat at the hands of an inferior force under
Carrera, near Arada, in Chiquimula, on the 2d of
February, which compelled a precipitate retreat into
Salvadoran territory.<a name='FA_XIII-76' id='FA_XIII-76' href='#FN_XIII-76' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-76]</a> Carrera then marched across
the line and established his headquarters in Santa

the part of Salvador for self-defence.<a name='FA_XIII-77' id='FA_XIII-77' href='#FN_XIII-77' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-77]</a>
</p>

<p>
Carrera wrote the government of Salvador February
22d, that, understanding it wished to make peace,
but hesitated to propose it because of the presence of
Guatemalan troops in Salvador, he would recross the
line, starting on the next day.<a name='FA_XIII-78' id='FA_XIII-78' href='#FN_XIII-78' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-78]</a> Yet the war continued,
until a definitive treaty of peace between Guatemala

on the 14th of September.<a name='FA_XIII-79' id='FA_XIII-79' href='#FN_XIII-79' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-79]</a>
</p>

<p>
The civil strife raging in Guatemala led to differences
with Honduras, whose government was accused of
favoring the rebels of the mountain. Recriminations
and border raids ensued, which culminated in a three
years' war between the two countries, Guatemala aiding
Guardiola and other enemies of Cabañas, the president

<p class="sidenote">REORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT.</p>

<p class="p2">
The victorious aristocrats now saw their opportunity
to reorganize the government under a system
more in accordance with their ideas; that is to say,
investing the executive with power to crush revolution.
Paredes summoned the constituent assembly
which had been called by Carrera's decree of May 24,
1848, and it was installed on the 16th of August,
1851. This body on the 19th of October adopted a
new constitution under the title of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Acta Constitutiva
de la República de Guatemala</span>, containing 18 articles.<a name='FA_XIII-82' id='FA_XIII-82' href='#FN_XIII-82' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-82]</a>

CARRERA REX.
</p>

<p>
The constituent assembly having by the 18th article
of the acta reserved to itself the right of choosing
the president for the constitutional term from January
1, 1852, to January 1, 1856, chose the only possible
candidate, Rafael Carrera,<a name='FA_XIII-84' id='FA_XIII-84' href='#FN_XIII-84' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-84]</a> who on the appointed day
assumed the executive office. His reputation for
courage, respect for the church, and other circumstances
secured a firm support to his administration.
On the 21st of October, 1854, Carrera was proclaimed
by a general junta of superior authorities president
for life,<a name='FA_XIII-85' id='FA_XIII-85' href='#FN_XIII-85' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-85]</a> and the house of representatives on the 29th
of January, 1855, passed an act exempting the president
from all responsibility for the acts of his government,
and devolving it on his ministers.<a name='FA_XIII-86' id='FA_XIII-86' href='#FN_XIII-86' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-86]</a> This
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_283' name='Page_283' href='#Page_283'>283</a></span>
change was a near approach to the monarchical system,
for which Carrera was supposed to have a decided
penchant.<a name='FA_XIII-87' id='FA_XIII-87' href='#FN_XIII-87' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-87]</a> Notwithstanding the strong power thus
placed in his hands, a revolt at Quezaltenango the
next year almost overthrew him, requiring the use of
all his forces to defeat it, at the expense of much disaster
and a large number of executions. It was only
by great efforts that he succeeded, after so many years
of warfare, in quieting the revolted mountaineers.
This was accomplished only after peace had been
signed with Honduras. His strong supporters, Manuel
Francisco Pavon and Luis Batres, died, the
former in 1855, and the latter in 1862.<a name='FA_XIII-88' id='FA_XIII-88' href='#FN_XIII-88' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-88]</a>
</p>

<p>
From this time, peace being finally restored, with
only occasional and partial disturbances, the régime
established with Carrera at its head was generally
acquiesced in. The republic took an active part in
the campaign against William Walker and his filibusters
in Nicaragua. The services rendered by its
forces will appear in the description of the operations
of that campaign in a separate chapter.
</p>

<p>
The year 1863 was inaugurated with another bloody
war with Salvador, the details and consequences of
which will be treated elsewhere. It is sufficient to
say here that Guatemalan arms were successful, and
Carrera's power became still more consolidated, and
its supremacy was felt over the rest of Central America.
He ruled the country uninterruptedly till his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
death early in April 1865. The highest honors, civic,
military, and ecclesiastic, were paid to his remains.<a name='FA_XIII-89' id='FA_XIII-89' href='#FN_XIII-89' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-89]</a>
Carrera died in the full conviction that he had been
the instrument of providence in saving society and
good order in Guatemala. He had been so assured
by his supporters, and had come to believe it, in the
face of the fact that he had been guilty of heinous
crimes and was notoriously immoral.<a name='FA_XIII-90' id='FA_XIII-90' href='#FN_XIII-90' class='fnanchor'>[XIII-90]</a> So die those

<p>
The constituent assembly of Salvador, installed at
Zacatecoluca on the 1st of August, 1839, after a recess
reopened its session on the 2d of January, 1841, and
on the 4th there was laid before it an address, signed
by Colonel Francisco Malespin, as comandante general,
and his officers who took part in the revolt of September
20th, spoken of elsewhere. In the document
they disclaimed hostility to Jefe Cañas or his minister,
or any intent to override the laws, asserting that they
were, on the contrary, actuated by a strong desire to
give security to the state, and save themselves from
impending destruction.<a name='FA_XIV-1' id='FA_XIV-1' href='#FN_XIV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-1]</a> This address was regarded
by the liberals as a threat, inasmuch as Malespin with
the garrison had wrongfully assumed a right to deliberate
upon public affairs.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'>286</a></span>

<p>
Norberto Ramirez, now jefe of Salvador by the
grace of Malespin, could no longer brook that officer's
interference, and resigned,<a name='FA_XIV-2' id='FA_XIV-2' href='#FN_XIV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-2]</a> Juan Lindo being called
to succeed him on the 7th of January. The assembly
and chief magistrate of the state were both now under
the sword of Malespin, which in its turn was controlled
by Carrera of Guatemala. That body, on the
30th of January, 1841, passed an act to call the state
in future República del Salvador.<a name='FA_XIV-3' id='FA_XIV-3' href='#FN_XIV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-3]</a> The second constitution
of Salvador was adopted on the 18th of February.<a name='FA_XIV-4' id='FA_XIV-4' href='#FN_XIV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-4]</a>
Under it the legislature had two chambers.
Lindo, the jefe, had a most unpleasant position, believing
himself surrounded by conspirators. Counting
on Malespin's support, on the 6th of November, 1841,
with a coup d'etat he dissolved the chambers, because
among its members were some friends of Morazan.<a name='FA_XIV-5' id='FA_XIV-5' href='#FN_XIV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-5]</a>
His act caused much indignation in several towns,
and on the 13th of January, 1842, three senators,
namely, J. V. Nuila, Lupario Vides, and Antonio
José Cañas, at San Vicente, resolved to restore constitutional
order. The legislative body in consequence
assembled there, and made a stirring address to the
people, embodying the policy they intended to pursue.<a name='FA_XIV-6' id='FA_XIV-6' href='#FN_XIV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-6]</a>
Lindo tried to justify his act of November 6th, but
failed, and Senator Escolástico Marin was called to
temporarily occupy the executive chair,<a name='FA_XIV-7' id='FA_XIV-7' href='#FN_XIV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-7]</a> with authority
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
to establish the state capital where most expedient.<a name='FA_XIV-8' id='FA_XIV-8' href='#FN_XIV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-8]</a>
The government continued for the time being in San
Vicente, and the people were called upon to choose a
president of the state.

<p class="sidenote">
ARCE, MARIN, GUZMAN.
</p>

<p>
Marin held the executive authority a few days only.
He had been preceded by Pedro Arce, and was succeeded
by Juan José Guzman. The difficulties of the
state had not come to an end. Guzman favored the
conservative element, as shown in his decree of June
3, 1842, issued after hearing that Morazan was in
Costa Rica, to cut off all relations with that state.<a name='FA_XIV-9' id='FA_XIV-9' href='#FN_XIV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-9]</a>
He left the executive office in July, and resumed its
duties again in September, declaring in a proclamation
that he would deal mercilessly with disturbers of the
public peace.
</p>

<p>
The two legislative chambers were installed at San
Vicente on the 17th of September, and on the 20th
counted the votes for president of the state. No candidate
having the requisite majority, Guzman was
asked to continue provisionally in charge of the
government. His inaugural address was a repetition
of his manifesto of the 7th, greatly pleasing the conservatives.<a name='FA_XIV-10' id='FA_XIV-10' href='#FN_XIV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-10]</a>
But harmony was not long to prevail
between Salvador and Guatemala. The trouble arose
from the independent action of Salvador in granting
an asylum to the remnants of Morazan's forces against
the protests of Guatemala and Honduras, even though
the final decree of admission contained some very
severe clauses.<a name='FA_XIV-11' id='FA_XIV-11' href='#FN_XIV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-11]</a> Another cause of dissatisfaction
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
against Salvador was that Guzman would not muzzle
the press. The independence of Guzman, and the
disposition shown by Malespin not to be at all times a
facile instrument of the aristocrats, prompted the latter
to promote an insurrection of the volcaneños of
Santa Ana for their overthrow.<a name='FA_XIV-12' id='FA_XIV-12' href='#FN_XIV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-12]</a> Salvador, though
under the pressure of aristocratic control, still had a
leaven of progression that made itself felt. The publication
of <i>El Amigo del Pueblo</i> was an evidence of this
fact. The Aycinenas, Pavon, Luis Batres, and Chatfield,
unable to compete with it in the field of discussion,
demanded its suppression.<a name='FA_XIV-13' id='FA_XIV-13' href='#FN_XIV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
Guzman in his correspondence with Pavon upheld
that journal, and Malespin would read it with satisfaction.<a name='FA_XIV-14' id='FA_XIV-14' href='#FN_XIV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-14]</a>
Guatemala resolved at least to use coercion.
Carrera established his headquarters at Jutiapa to
favor the volcaneños in their rebellion.<a name='FA_XIV-15' id='FA_XIV-15' href='#FN_XIV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-15]</a>

REVOLUTION.
</p>

<p>
The cordial reception given in October to Colonel
M. Quijans, commissioner accredited by Nicaragua to
Salvador to negotiate a treaty of friendship and alliance,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>
was displeasing to Bishop Viteri, who took advantage
of Guzman's absence at San Vicente, in the
latter part of that month, to bring about a quarrel
between him and Malespin. The latter at this time
was said to be in poor health, and the bishop often
visited him, and in other ways manifested interest for
him. Viteri had directed his clergy to abstain from
interference in political affairs, and yet he preached
against Morazan and those who had banished Archbishop
Casans. The Dominican Vazquez<a name='FA_XIV-16' id='FA_XIV-16' href='#FN_XIV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-16]</a> was virulent,
declaring that the ecclesiastical authority would
never be under the civil, and threatening the people
that the priests would abandon them to suffer from
plagues, epidemics, war, and famine, if they continued
their iniquitous hostility to the church.<a name='FA_XIV-17' id='FA_XIV-17' href='#FN_XIV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-17]</a>
</p>

<p>
The revolution was now a fact. Viteri and Malespin
supported Fray Vazquez, or Fray Veneno, as he
was nicknamed. Once Vazquez fulminated from the
pulpit a number of diatribes against President Guzman,
at the same time bestowing much praise on
Carrera. The result was an order from Guzman, then
at San Miguel, to bring the friar there as a prisoner.
The bishop remonstrated to Malespin against the
order, demanding an escort, as he wished to end the
insults to the church by himself leaving the state.
Malespin tried to dissuade him from his purpose, and
he grew more energetic.<a name='FA_XIV-18' id='FA_XIV-18' href='#FN_XIV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-18]</a> A great tumult ensued
one night in the city, when Viteri, Malespin, and
Vazquez received an ovation from the rabble of
La Vega and San Jacinto, amid repeated cries of
"<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mueran los judios! mueran los herejes! mueran los
impíos!</span>"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Malespin went off to San Miguel, and had some
violent correspondence with the president; the latter
threatened to expose his intrigues if he did not forthwith
depart from San Miguel, and then retired to his
hacienda, leaving the state in the hands of Malespin.<a name='FA_XIV-19' id='FA_XIV-19' href='#FN_XIV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-19]</a>
Guzman's downfall was hailed with joy in Guatemala
and Honduras. In Comayagua it was celebrated with
salvos of artillery. After Malespin's return to San
Salvador, to please the bishop several persons were
banished, and the <i>Amigo del Pueblo</i> was suppressed.
The executive office, by Guzman's abandonment of it,
went into the hands of Pedro Arce, the vice-president.
The two chambers of the assembly opened their session
on the 30th of January, 1844. No presidential
candidate having a constitutional majority, the assembly
chose Malespin president, and he assumed his new
duties on the 5th of February, after reading before
the two bodies in assembly convened a discourse on
his great love for law, justice, and peace. It would
have sounded well from the lips of a liberal, and it is
barely possible that Malespin expressed his sentiments
at that moment. But his education, his habits, and
the fatal influence of the men that swayed him, constantly
took him out of the right path. As he was
under the control of Bishop Viteri, the country must
go back to the days of obscurantism. The effects of
it were soon made patent.<a name='FA_XIV-20' id='FA_XIV-20' href='#FN_XIV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-20]</a>
</p>

<p>
The bishop succeeded in driving out of the state the
opponents of his theocratic ideas, and in bringing about
a change in the government; in fact, everything had
been conceded him, and his influence was paramount.
And yet he was not satisfied. He would have the
Salvadorans believe him a deity, but they arrived at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_291' name='Page_291' href='#Page_291'>291</a></span>
the conclusion that by a great fatality their first
bishop had turned out to be a pernicious revolutionist.
</p>

<p>
In connection with the general history of Central
America, I have given the principal events of Salvador
down to 1845, when, under the treaty of Sensenti,
after a long and exhaustive war with Honduras, the
state was rid of the ominous rule of the brutal Malespin.
With the discontinuance of the war there was
no need of raising further loans; the military establishment
was reduced to a minimum, and the authorities
and people hastened to restore the constitutional
régime; to which end elections of senators and deputies
were at once had, in order that the assembly
should meet on the 15th of January, 1846, for the
term of Vice-president Joaquin Eustacio Guzman, who
had charge of the executive authority, would expire
on the 1st of February.<a name='FA_XIV-21' id='FA_XIV-21' href='#FN_XIV-21' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-21]</a> On this date he surrendered
the office to Senator Fermin Palacios. The assembly
did not meet till four days after. The presidential
election did not yield a sufficient majority in favor of
any one, and the assembly then appointed Eugenio
Aguilar.<a name='FA_XIV-22' id='FA_XIV-22' href='#FN_XIV-22' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-22]</a> The president was a good Christian, and
attended with regularity to his religious duties as a
catholic; and yet Viteri called him a heretic; the
reason of it being that Aguilar was a stickler for a
constitutional government of the people, and the
bishop was an oligarch. The latter now invented the
fiction that the president had the intention of exiling
him; he had the people in the wards of Candelaria,
San Estévan, and Calvario told that their bishop was
to be sent out of the country in the night of the 11th
of July. He was believed by the simple-minded people
when he assured them that Aguilar and others<a name='FA_XIV-23' id='FA_XIV-23' href='#FN_XIV-23' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-23]</a> were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_292' name='Page_292' href='#Page_292'>292</a></span>
at the bottom of it. His report made a commotion
though not quite so great a one as he had expected.
Nevertheless, he made the most of it, writing to the
president, on the 11th of July, that he knew of the
plot to repeat with him what had been done with
Archbishop Casans, in 1829.<a name='FA_XIV-24' id='FA_XIV-24' href='#FN_XIV-24' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-24]</a> Aguilar was greatly
surprised, and believing that with a few words he
could convince the bishop of his error, that same afternoon
paid the prelate a visit. He found a large
concourse of people, before whom the charge was
reiterated, and no assurance to the contrary was accepted.
A tumult following, the president had the chief
guard-house reënforced. Fortunately, a heavy rain
scattered to their homes the crowds in the streets; but
a considerable number of men ran into the episcopal
residence. That night, several persons representing
Viteri went to the barracks and demanded Aguilar's
resignation. The president meekly assured them of
his willingness to retire to private life rather than be
the author of any disturbance. Viteri now thought
Aguilar was vanquished, but he had not counted on
the determination of other Salvadorans to uphold the
laws and the government. Quiet was restored for
the time, and Aguilar went to his home at midnight
unmolested. The next day there was much rioting,
and an attempt failed to release the prisoners in
the jail.<a name='FA_XIV-25' id='FA_XIV-25' href='#FN_XIV-25' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-25]</a> The rioters were finally defeated, and the
bishop had nothing to show for his conduct but the
blood shed at his instigation.<a name='FA_XIV-26' id='FA_XIV-26' href='#FN_XIV-26' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-26]</a> Aguilar again, after
the people had upheld his authority, showed the weakness
of his character in placing the executive office in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_293' name='Page_293' href='#Page_293'>293</a></span>
the hands of Senator Palacios; which emboldened
Viteri to continue his intrigues and cause further
trouble. He issued a pastoral on the 16th of July,
printed in his own house, which reiterated the accusation
against the president, and other matters; that
pastoral<a name='FA_XIV-27' id='FA_XIV-27' href='#FN_XIV-27' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-27]</a> was fatal to his views, for the people of
Salvador made Aguilar resume the presidency. The
president, in a long manifesto, explained his conduct,
and issued a decree to enforce the articles of the penal
code against ecclesiastics who made use of their ministerial
office to promote political disturbances.<a name='FA_XIV-28' id='FA_XIV-28' href='#FN_XIV-28' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-28]</a> The
bishop, condemned by public opinion, fled to Guatemala,
and the president then on the 29th revoked a
decree of Palacios of July 12th, and ordered Viteri
not to return to Salvadoran territory.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
A WEAK EXECUTIVE.
</p>

<p>
Peace and order prevailed after Viteri's departure,
and the people again devoted themselves to their
usual vocations. But the bishop managed with Malespin
and the Honduran oligarchs, notwithstanding
the treaty of Sensenti, to bring about a revolution in
Salvador.<a name='FA_XIV-29' id='FA_XIV-29' href='#FN_XIV-29' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-29]</a> Malespin attacked Chalatenango, in Salvador,
whereupon orders were given to send troops
after him.<a name='FA_XIV-30' id='FA_XIV-30' href='#FN_XIV-30' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-30]</a> Viteri who had once excommunicated
Malespin, and aided in his overthrow, now said that
he was destined by divine providence to defend the
religion and rights of the people of Salvador, which
had been infamously abused and usurped by their
government. Malespin preached religion, and acted
like the famous king of the Huns. But his prestige
was gone, and at Dulce Nombre de la Palma he met
with his first reverse, when he retreated to Dulce
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
Nombre de María, a town twelve miles from the Honduran
frontier, and invited Viteri to join him; but
that worthy sent him his blessing, and would not expose
his person to the hazards of war. Malespin was
defeated again by eight hundred men under General
Nicolás Angulo, and fled into Honduras, leaving arms
and ammunition. Efforts were made to induce the
people of Santa Ana to join Ignacio Malespin; but
the bishop's letters to rouse them availed but little.
He found no favor among the volcaneños, and on his
way along the coast to reach Santiago Nonualco was
captured, prosecuted, and executed, with some of his
accomplices.<a name='FA_XIV-31' id='FA_XIV-31' href='#FN_XIV-31' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-31]</a> Francisco Malespin was killed at San
Fernando, near Honduras, the inhabitants cutting off
his head, and carrying it as a trophy to San Salvador.<a name='FA_XIV-32' id='FA_XIV-32' href='#FN_XIV-32' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-32]</a>
Bishop Viteri in 1847 went to reside in Nicaragua,
becoming a citizen of the state, to which diocese he
was subsequently translated by the pope. Nothing
worthy of mention occurred within the state in 1847.
The Salvador government now represented the liberal
party in Central America, and devoted its attention
to education, arts, and industries.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PRESIDENT VASCONCELOS.
</p>

<p>
The presidential term under the constitution being
only of two years, elections were orderly effected, and
the assembly opened its session on the 25th of January,
1848. Doroteo Vasconcelos was the popular choice
for the presidential term of 1848, and entered upon
his duties on the 7th of February, 1848.<a name='FA_XIV-33' id='FA_XIV-33' href='#FN_XIV-33' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-33]</a> In a conciliatory
address he eschewed all spirit of partisanship,
tendering to all his fellow-citizens peace, justice, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
union.<a name='FA_XIV-34' id='FA_XIV-34' href='#FN_XIV-34' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-34]</a> For all that, the oligarchs abhorred him.
Indeed, his government and Carrera's could not exist
so near each other. The aristocrats well knew he was
not to be won over to their side, as well as the difficulties
they must work against to undermine his popularity.
But they looked for early success from
internal dissension and other sources.<a name='FA_XIV-35' id='FA_XIV-35' href='#FN_XIV-35' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-35]</a> Aguilar's administration
had refused to recognize the republic of
Guatemala, and Vasconcelos' could do no less.<a name='FA_XIV-36' id='FA_XIV-36' href='#FN_XIV-36' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-36]</a>
</p>

<p>
The territory was twice invaded by troops of Guatemala
in pursuit of insurgents, against which Vasconcelos
remonstrated, and satisfaction was given and
accepted with good grace. He was observing a policy
of expectancy, albeit on his guard. Guatemala was
then in the throes of revolution from which he expected
to see the Central American nation spring into
a second life; but he was mistaken in the means he
employed. A few proclamations, written in Guatemala
by well-known persons, and appearing in the
name of Francisco Carrillo, spoke of the independence
of Los Altos as the aim of a revolution such as Vasconcelos
wanted.<a name='FA_XIV-37' id='FA_XIV-37' href='#FN_XIV-37' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-37]</a> Not that he expected to see an
absolute equality of the state, but that there should
not be such differences as existed under the constitution
of 1824. He believed himself supported, and
steadily marched on upon a path that led to his ruin,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
carrying down with him the whole liberal party of
Central America.
</p>

<p>
Vasconcelos labored for a federation of three states—Guatemala,
Salvador, and Los Altos—which once
consolidated, Nicaragua and Honduras would doubtlessly
join, and later on attract Costa Rica to do the
same. This idea had no opposition before the revolution
of August 1848, in Guatemala. Vasconcelos
received many offers of support to prosecute his plan.
He accordingly instructed Dueñas and General Angulo
to enter into arrangements with General Nufio of
Chiquimula, and made every possible effort to force
Carrera's resignation on the 15th of August, 1848;
but some of the liberals of Guatemala, after ridding
themselves of Carrera, neglected Vasconcelos. Dueñas
was sent there with ample powers for the organization
of a republic of Central America, but he was
slighted, and accomplished nothing. During his stay
in Guatemala, a decree was enacted on the 14th of
September, 1848, according to which that state was
declared a sovereign nation and independent republic.<a name='FA_XIV-38' id='FA_XIV-38' href='#FN_XIV-38' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-38]</a>
Vasconcelos, with all his liberalism, and placed
as he was at the head of a liberty-loving democratic
people, was still under the influence of the old colonial
traditions. He as well as his people looked with
admiration at the greatness of the United States of
America, but lacked the courage to emulate their
example. The United States had no official church,
but Salvador recognized one. Licenciado Ignacio
Gomez was despatched to Rome to negotiate the recall
of Bishop Viteri, the appointment of another prelate,
and the conclusion of a concordat.<a name='FA_XIV-39' id='FA_XIV-39' href='#FN_XIV-39' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-39]</a> His mission
was so far successful that on the 3d of July, 1848,
Tomás Miguel Pineda y Zaldaña was preconizated as
bishop of Antigona in partibus infidelium, and given
the administration of the diocese of Salvador, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_297' name='Page_297' href='#Page_297'>297</a></span>
the right of succession. The news of this appointment
was received with joy, and Vasconcelos erroneously
expected to have a support in the new prelate,<a name='FA_XIV-40' id='FA_XIV-40' href='#FN_XIV-40' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-40]</a>
when there was more likelihood of his coinciding with
Pavon and his confrères. Indeed, Zaldaña, from his
greater wariness, was a more dangerous man than
Viteri.
</p>

<p>
The legislative chambers met on the 5th of February,
1849. The president's term would end with the
beginning of 1850, and there could be no reëlection
under the constitution.<a name='FA_XIV-41' id='FA_XIV-41' href='#FN_XIV-41' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-41]</a> But Vasconcelos' friends insisted
on his being reëlected, necessitating an amendment
of the fundamental law, and in spite of opposition
obtained an act of the assembly permitting the reëlection.<a name='FA_XIV-42' id='FA_XIV-42' href='#FN_XIV-42' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-42]</a>
This was an unfortunate move, as it divided
the liberal party, and encouraged Dueñas, who wanted
the presidency, and was not scrupulous as to the means
of attaining it, to redouble his manœuvres, even though
he must call to his aid Carrera and Luis Batres.

<p class="sidenote">
BRITISH INTERMEDDLING.
</p>

<p class="p2">
In 1849, Salvador became involved in a quarrel
with the British chargé d'affaires, Chatfield, resulting
from alleged claims preferred by him with his usual
haughtiness, on behalf of fellow-subjects of his. Vasconcelos'
government looked on these claims as unjust,
and refused them recognition. Chatfield then
caused the blockading by a naval force of La Union,
the port from which Salvador derived the greater
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_298' name='Page_298' href='#Page_298'>298</a></span>
portion of her revenue.<a name='FA_XIV-43' id='FA_XIV-43' href='#FN_XIV-43' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-43]</a> Unable to resist, her government
agreed on the 12th of November, 1849, to
acknowledge the indebtedness, and make provision for
its payment. The blockade was then raised.<a name='FA_XIV-44' id='FA_XIV-44' href='#FN_XIV-44' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-44]</a> But
this did not end the disagreements between Chatfield
and the Salvador government. On the 6th of August
he made peremptory demands,<a name='FA_XIV-45' id='FA_XIV-45' href='#FN_XIV-45' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-45]</a> coupled with a menace
that if not complied with at once the coasts of the state
would be blockaded by British war ships then coming
to act under his instructions. The government of Salvador
did not comply with the demands,<a name='FA_XIV-46' id='FA_XIV-46' href='#FN_XIV-46' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-46]</a> and on the
16th of October port La Union was blockaded by
the British ship <i>Champion</i>, whose commander notified
the authorities that if within ten days full satisfaction
were not given for the insults to the British flag, the
blockade would be extended to the whole coast, another
vessel being despatched to Acajutla to enforce it. No
satisfaction having been given as demanded, that
menace was carried out. The difficulties remained
unsettled in the latter part of February 1851, though
the British war vessels had retired.<a name='FA_XIV-47' id='FA_XIV-47' href='#FN_XIV-47' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-47]</a> But they were
subsequently arranged in an amicable manner. With
the exception of these troubles, and the repeated differences
with the other states of Central America, Salvador
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_299' name='Page_299' href='#Page_299'>299</a></span>

<p class="sidenote">MULTIPLIED HOSTILITIES.</p>

<p class="p2">
Vasconcelos was not more successful in preserving
peace within the state than in forcing Guatemala to
abandon the policy she had adopted of maintaining an
absolute autonomy. In his invasion of that neighbor's
territory early in 1851, as we have seen in the
previous chapter, he was worsted, which roused popular
indignation against him, followed by a revolt,
and his deposal by congress.<a name='FA_XIV-49' id='FA_XIV-49' href='#FN_XIV-49' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-49]</a> On the 1st of March,

constitutional term 1852-3 was Francisco Dueñas,
who succeeded in settling the differences existing
between Salvador and Guatemala.
</p>

<p>
A serious disagreement having occurred between
Salvador and Honduras, leading to hostilities, the
government of Guatemala, then at war with Honduras,
despatched a force to Ahuachapan in aid of
Dueñas, who apprehended an invasion.<a name='FA_XIV-51' id='FA_XIV-51' href='#FN_XIV-51' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-51]</a> Toward
the end of this term José María de San Martin was
chosen for the next. The state now returned in peace

to its interior affairs, adopting important improvements.<a name='FA_XIV-52' id='FA_XIV-52' href='#FN_XIV-52' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-52]</a>
There were not wanting, however, some
attempts to disturb the public peace, which were fortunately
defeated. But the country became at that
time the victim of other calamities, such as cholera,
scarcity of food resulting from a visitation of locusts,
and an earthquake which destroyed San Salvador on
the 16th of April, 1854,<a name='FA_XIV-53' id='FA_XIV-53' href='#FN_XIV-53' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-53]</a> in consequence of which the
capital was removed to Cojutepeque, where it remained
for some time.
</p>

<p>
Rafael Campo and Francisco Dueñas were elected
president and vice-president, respectively, for the ensuing
term of 1856-7; and the latter being in charge
of the executive office in January 1856, in Campo's
absence, fitted out a contingent of troops to aid Nicaragua
in her struggle with Walker's filibusters.
Campo despatched reënforcements in 1857, the Salvador
forces being under command of General Gerardo
Barrios, who, according to Perez, never went beyond
Leon,<a name='FA_XIV-54' id='FA_XIV-54' href='#FN_XIV-54' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-54]</a> but undertook to arrange the internal affairs of
Nicaragua, convoking a junta de notables, which proclaimed
Juan Sacasa president. This had no effect,
however.

General Belloso, Colonel Choto, and other officers
of the expedition deserted in June from Leon. Barrios
sent troops after them, and they were arrested in Salvador
and taken as prisoners to Cojutepeque, where
they told President Campo that Barrios had invited
them to make a revolution against his government.
They were set at liberty on the 8th. Barrios landed
at La Libertad with his forces on the 6th, and
marched to San Salvador, whence he wrote Campo
he had occupied that place to defeat the revolutionary
schemes of Belloso and Choto. Orders were sent him
to dissolve the forces and go to Cojutepeque with 200
men. On the 11th Barrios, together with his officers,
made a pronunciamiento to depose Campo and call
Dueñas to the presidency.<a name='FA_XIV-56' id='FA_XIV-56' href='#FN_XIV-56' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-56]</a> The president on the
12th called troops to the support of his government,
placed San Salvador and Cojutepeque under martial
law, and declared all acts emanating from the vice-president
void. But it seems that the latter refused
to lend himself to Barrios' plan, but on the contrary,
supported Campo.<a name='FA_XIV-57' id='FA_XIV-57' href='#FN_XIV-57' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-57]</a> Barrios himself submitted.<a name='FA_XIV-58' id='FA_XIV-58' href='#FN_XIV-58' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-58]</a>

Campo's successor was Miguel Santin del Castillo.
This president's tenure of office was of short duration.
In 1858 a coup d'etat of Barrios, then a senator,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
in which he was aided by the vice-president Guzman,
his father-in-law, forced Santin to resign. Barrios
subsequently obtained from the legislative assembly,
sitting from January 17 to February 12, 1859, the
sanction of his coup d'etat, as well as the constitutional
amendments that he had not been able to

and that of the deputies from two to four years.<a name='FA_XIV-59' id='FA_XIV-59' href='#FN_XIV-59' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-59]</a>
The year 1859 was one of restlessness, engendered
partly by the ungrounded fear of invasion by Santin's
friends, who had taken refuge in neighboring states,
and partly by Barrios' efforts to secure his own election
to the presidency, in which he was successful.
In August 1859 the existing disagreements between
Salvador and Honduras, resulting from intrigues of
refugees from the former, were brought to an end
through the mediation of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XIV-60' id='FA_XIV-60' href='#FN_XIV-60' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-60]</a>

INVASION OF SANTA ANA.

<p>
The republic seemed to have attained a comparatively
stable condition at the incoming of 1860. Barrios
had been elected president, and recognized as such
by the assembly.<a name='FA_XIV-61' id='FA_XIV-61' href='#FN_XIV-61' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-61]</a> He concluded in 1862 to hold
diplomatic relations with the vice-president, who under
the constitution of Honduras was entitled to
occupy the executive chair of that state at the death
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'>303</a></span>
of President Guardiola, and was favored by public
opinion, although Carrera of Guatemala was upholding
Medina, a usurper of the presidency. A treaty
of alliance, both defensive and offensive, was entered
into between Salvador and this vice-president,<a name='FA_XIV-62' id='FA_XIV-62' href='#FN_XIV-62' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-62]</a> which
displeased Carrera; he demanded explanations, and
they were given him.<a name='FA_XIV-63' id='FA_XIV-63' href='#FN_XIV-63' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-63]</a> The latter found an excuse to
pick a quarrel with Barrios in the question with the
Salvador clergy, who had been required to take an
oath of allegiance to the government,<a name='FA_XIV-64' id='FA_XIV-64' href='#FN_XIV-64' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-64]</a> which they
refused to do, Bishop Pineda y Zaldaña and a number
of his subordinates repairing to Guatemala, where
they were honorably received. Barrios was accused
in the official journal of setting aside the conservative
policy promised at his inauguration.<a name='FA_XIV-65' id='FA_XIV-65' href='#FN_XIV-65' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-65]</a> An expedition,
under Colonel Saenz, believed to have been aided by
Carrera, invaded Santa Ana at the cry of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva la religion</span>!
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Viva el obispo</span>! and took the city, but were
soon driven away by the citizens. Carrera disclaimed
any connection with this affair. Some time after came
Máximo Jerez, as minister of Nicaragua, proposing a
plan of national union for Salvador, Honduras, and
Nicaragua, with the intention of inviting Guatemala
and Costa Rica to join them; but the project failed
because of the refusal of Honduras to enter into the
arrangement. Carrera had meantime dissuaded President
Martinez of Nicaragua from the scheme.
</p>

<p>
The Guatemalan government was preparing for war
against Salvador, and succeeded in winning the coöperation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'>304</a></span>
of Martinez.<a name='FA_XIV-66' id='FA_XIV-66' href='#FN_XIV-66' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-66]</a> Honduras, being an ally of Salvador,
Florencio Xatruch was assisted by Carrera to
make a revolt in several departments against the government
of Honduras. Salvador tried to avert hostilities.
Friends of peace, among them the American
and British representatives, mediated, but all was of
no avail.<a name='FA_XIV-67' id='FA_XIV-67' href='#FN_XIV-67' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-67]</a>

OFFICE-SEEKERS WAR.
</p>

<p>
The war contemplated by Carrera was unpopular
in Guatemala, where the people of late years had been
enjoying peace and prosperity, and feared a recurrence
of the former desolations. But their ruler was
prompted by a deadly animosity to Barrios, and by
the fear that the alliance of the latter with Jerez
would endanger conservatism, and consequently his
own power. Whereupon he resolved to crush at one
blow the disturber of the public peace, as Barrios was
called by the oligarchs.<a name='FA_XIV-68' id='FA_XIV-68' href='#FN_XIV-68' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-68]</a> He invaded Salvador with
a large force, a proclamation preceding him to inform
the people that the war would be against Barrios
and not themselves. He felt certain of a speedy victory,
and blindly assailed Coatepeque, where Barrios
was entrenched. He was repulsed with such heavy
losses<a name='FA_XIV-69' id='FA_XIV-69' href='#FN_XIV-69' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-69]</a> that he had to retreat to his own capital,
which he entered March 6th at the head of only 3,000
men. But this reverse did not discourage him. He
fitted out another army, and started upon a second
campaign that should be decisive<a name='FA_XIV-70' id='FA_XIV-70' href='#FN_XIV-70' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-70]</a> against Salvador
and Honduras, the latter having espoused Barrios'
cause. Meantime Martinez of Nicaragua had gained
a battle at the town of San Felipe on the 29th of
April, against a united force of Jerez' partisans and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
Salvadorans.<a name='FA_XIV-71' id='FA_XIV-71' href='#FN_XIV-71' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-71]</a> Moreover, Honduras was invaded by
800 Guatemalans under General Cerna. The Salvadoran
and Honduran troops were defeated<a name='FA_XIV-72' id='FA_XIV-72' href='#FN_XIV-72' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-72]</a> by the
allied Guatemalans and Nicaraguans, on the plains of
Santa Rosa, which prompted revolts in the greater
part of the departments of Salvador, proclaiming
Dueñas provisional president, who organized a government
at Sonsonate.<a name='FA_XIV-73' id='FA_XIV-73' href='#FN_XIV-73' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-73]</a> Intrigues were successfully
brought into play upon several Salvadoran commanders
to induce them to revolt against Barrios, and to
aid his enemies.<a name='FA_XIV-74' id='FA_XIV-74' href='#FN_XIV-74' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-74]</a> One of those officers was General
Santiago Gonzalez, commanding the troops at Santa
Ana during Barrios' temporary absence at San Salvador.
He made a pronunciamiento on the 30th of
June, telling the soldiers that a similar movement
had taken place the previous day at the capital, and
Barrios was a prisoner, and his government dissolved.
On discovering the deception some battalions escaped
and joined the president at San Salvador, Gonzalez
being left with a small number of troops. Carrera
was now near Santa Ana, and demanded Gonzalez'
surrender and recognition of Dueñas as provisional
president, which, being declined, Carrera attacked
and easily defeated him on the 3d of July,<a name='FA_XIV-75' id='FA_XIV-75' href='#FN_XIV-75' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-75]</a> the Salvadoran
artillery and a large quantity of ammunition
falling into the victor's hands. Carrera was now
master of the situation,<a name='FA_XIV-76' id='FA_XIV-76' href='#FN_XIV-76' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-76]</a> and his opponent virtually
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
without means of defence, superadded to which the
influence of the clergy had turned the Indians to
Carrera's side. Barrios continued his efforts, however,
and held out four months at San Salvador,
though closely besieged and suffering from want of
food and ammunition.<a name='FA_XIV-77' id='FA_XIV-77' href='#FN_XIV-77' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-77]</a> He had refused to listen to
proposals offering him the honors of war, believing
that once in Carrera's hands his fate would be sealed.<a name='FA_XIV-78' id='FA_XIV-78' href='#FN_XIV-78' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-78]</a>
At last further defence was impossible, and Barrios
escaped out of the city early on the 26th of October,
and subsequently out of the country.<a name='FA_XIV-79' id='FA_XIV-79' href='#FN_XIV-79' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-79]</a> The surrender
of the city took place the same day, and on the 30th
Dueñas, now placed at the head of affairs, decreed
thanks and honors to Carrera and Martinez, and their
respective armies.<a name='FA_XIV-80' id='FA_XIV-80' href='#FN_XIV-80' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-80]</a>

DEATH OF BARRIOS.
</p>

<p>
Barrios, having with him arms and ammunition,
embarked at Panamá in 1865, on the schooner <i>Manuela
Planas</i> for La Union, to place himself at the head of a
movement initiated by Cabañas in that port and San
Miguel in his favor. It was only on arrival that he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
heard of the failure of that movement,<a name='FA_XIV-81' id='FA_XIV-81' href='#FN_XIV-81' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-81]</a> and on his return
the schooner was struck by lightning in waters
off Nicaragua at the Aserradores. He sent to Corinto
for water and provisions, and the consequence was
that a Nicaraguan force came on board and captured
him. He was taken to Leon on the 30th of June.<a name='FA_XIV-82' id='FA_XIV-82' href='#FN_XIV-82' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-82]</a>
The government of Salvador demanded his extradition
that he might be tried, the national congress having
impeached him. The result of this was a convention
entered into at Leon July 14, 1865, between Gregorio
Arbizú, minister of Salvador, and Pedro Zeledon,
plenipotentiary for Nicaragua, by which the latter
government assented to the surrender of Barrios,
under the express stipulation that his life should be
spared whatever might be the result of his trial.<a name='FA_XIV-83' id='FA_XIV-83' href='#FN_XIV-83' class='fnanchor'>[XIV-83]</a>
But the government of Salvador, in disregard of this
obligation, had Barrios sentenced to death by a court-martial,
and he was executed at 4:30 in the morning
of August 29th, against the remonstrances of the representative
of Nicaragua. The latter could do nothing
but protest, and throw the infamy of the deed
upon Dueñas and his administration.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Bishop Zaldaña returned to his diocese at the termination
of the war in the latter part of 1863, and
issued a pastoral letter recommending concord and
union among his flock. The provisional government
called on the people to choose a constituent assembly
to reorganize the government and frame a new constitution.
This assembly met on the 18th of February,
1864, and on the same date sanctioned the last revolutionary
movement, which deposed Barrios from the
presidency, and called Dueñas to fill it. His acts to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_308' name='Page_308' href='#Page_308'>308</a></span>
that date were approved, and he was recognized as
provisional executive till a constitutional one should
be elected. That body at a later date promulgated a
new constitution in 104 articles, which like the fundamental
charters of the other Central American states
at that time was exceedingly conservative. The only
religion recognized was the Roman catholic.
</p>

<p>
At the elections which took place ten months after
the promulgation of the new charter, Dueñas was apparently
elected president for the first constitutional
term, and the constitutional congress recognized him
as such. He took formal possession of the office February
1, 1865. Congress closed its session on the
21st of the same month.

<p>
The house of representatives of the Estado Libre y
Soberano de Honduras, on the 30th of December,
1840, chose Francisco Ferrera president,<a name='FA_XV-1' id='FA_XV-1' href='#FN_XV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XV-1]</a> and he took
possession of the office on the 1st of January, 1841.
The chamber closed its session on the 6th of March.
</p>

<p>
It is unnecessary to repeat here the history of Honduras
down to 1844, as it has been given in connection
with other sections of Central America. The state
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_310' name='Page_310' href='#Page_310'>310</a></span>
assembly was installed on the 11th of January, with
ceremonies more religious than political, as befitted a
country where the influence of the church was so overwhelming.<a name='FA_XV-2' id='FA_XV-2' href='#FN_XV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XV-2]</a>
The chamber bepraised Ferrera with as
much gusto as the church had smoked him with
incense at the cathedral, and on the 26th he was
formally declared a benemérito de la patria, and confirmed
as a general of division, which rank had been
conferred on him by the government in March 1839.<a name='FA_XV-3' id='FA_XV-3' href='#FN_XV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XV-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
Much was said at the opening of the legislative
session about peace, but the fact was, that a number
of towns were greatly agitated, owing to the heavy
burdens weighing on them, and to the displeasure
caused by many citizens having been driven into exile.
Among these towns were Texiguat, La Plazuela, and
Comayagüela. Santos Guardiola was sent against
them, and was not successful, though he asserted in a
proclamation that he had defeated the rebels. The
war spread,<a name='FA_XV-4' id='FA_XV-4' href='#FN_XV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XV-4]</a> and Ferrera deemed it expedient to leave
the executive office in charge of the ministers for a
time, and to personally take command of the forces to
operate against the insurgents. Guardiola defeated
them at Corpus on the 1st of July, and captured their
correspondence, with Rivera, Orellana, and the other
leaders.<a name='FA_XV-5' id='FA_XV-5' href='#FN_XV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XV-5]</a>

REVOLUTION AND ELECTION.
</p>

<p>
An insurrection of the troops at Olancho took
place in December, which was soon quelled, and
stringent measures were adopted by Ferrera against
its promoters.<a name='FA_XV-6' id='FA_XV-6' href='#FN_XV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XV-6]</a> Amid this state of affairs Ferrera's
term was approaching its end, and he could not be reëlected
a second time under the constitution of 1839.
Elections were held, and arrangements made so that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_311' name='Page_311' href='#Page_311'>311</a></span>
he could continue in power as minister of war with
the chief command of the forces.<a name='FA_XV-7' id='FA_XV-7' href='#FN_XV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XV-7]</a> Guardiola had been
also dubbed a benemérito, and his friends wished to
raise him to the presidential chair, but did not succeed.<a name='FA_XV-8' id='FA_XV-8' href='#FN_XV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XV-8]</a>
No candidate obtained the requisite majority, and the
legislature chose Coronado Chavez president.<a name='FA_XV-9' id='FA_XV-9' href='#FN_XV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XV-9]</a>
</p>

<p>
Ex-jefe Rivera, taking advantage of the absence of
Ferrera with most of his forces in Nicaragua, invaded
Honduras for the purpose of overthrowing the existing
government. The people failed to coöperate with
him, and he was defeated and made prisoner. On the
4th of January, 1845, he, with Martinez, Landa, and
Julian Diaz arrived at Comayagua in irons. The
official journal announced that Rivera was to be tried
and punished. He was in fact doomed to the scaffold
before he was tried.<a name='FA_XV-10' id='FA_XV-10' href='#FN_XV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XV-10]</a>
</p>

<p>
Guardiola's atrocities in La Union and San Miguel,
spoken of in a former chapter, won him additional
honors from the subservient assembly of Honduras.
He was a second time declared a benemérito, and
awarded a gold medal. Chavez, the tool of Ferrera,
was not neglected. He was given the title of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Padre
conscripto de la patria</span>, with an accompanying medal.<a name='FA_XV-11' id='FA_XV-11' href='#FN_XV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XV-11]</a>
The assembly closed on the 23d of March, well satisfied
of the wisdom of its measures. Another presidential
election came up, and no one having the requisite
number of votes, the assembly, January 14,
1847, chose Ferrera, who declined the position, and
Juan Lindo was then appointed, Ferrera continuing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_312' name='Page_312' href='#Page_312'>312</a></span>
as war minister, with the command of the troops annexed,
which was what he desired. Guardiola was
retained in the office of minister of foreign relations,
though unfit for it.
</p>

<p>
When the army of the United States was in Mexico,
Lindo seemed greatly exasperated thereby; the president,
without first obtaining the sanction of the representatives,
issued manifestos, on the 1st and 2d of June,
1847, which were an open declaration of war against
the United States.<a name='FA_XV-12' id='FA_XV-12' href='#FN_XV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XV-12]</a>
</p>

<p>
Lindo desired to control affairs for an unlimited
time, and the constitution allowing him only a two-years
tenure, and containing, besides, several clauses
repugnant to him, it was doomed.<a name='FA_XV-13' id='FA_XV-13' href='#FN_XV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XV-13]</a> A constituent
assembly was accordingly called to frame a new charter,
which was adopted at Comayagua February 4,
1848.<a name='FA_XV-14' id='FA_XV-14' href='#FN_XV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XV-14]</a>
</p>

<p>
Lindo continued as president under the new régime.<a name='FA_XV-15' id='FA_XV-15' href='#FN_XV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XV-15]</a>
The legislature had assembled at Cedros on
the 10th of June, 1849, when the president reported
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_313' name='Page_313' href='#Page_313'>313</a></span>
the state at peace, and its relations with the other
states on a satisfactory footing. But he acknowledged
that his government was harassed by party contentions.
Order had been maintained thus far by a strict
impartiality toward the factions, with the coöperation
of some good and influential citizens.<a name='FA_XV-16' id='FA_XV-16' href='#FN_XV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XV-16]</a> This was not
to last long; for on the 12th of February, 1850,
Guardiola, deceived by representations of Felipe Jáuregui
and the aristocrats of Guatemala, in which the
British chargé, Chatfield, had no little part, made a
pronunciamiento at Tegucigalpa, where the government
then was, and Lindo had to flee. The latter
finally entrenched himself at Nacaome, near the bay
of Fonseca, and asked for assistance from the governments
of Salvador and Nicaragua, which under the
terms of their confederacy they were bound to afford
him. Salvador at once sent a considerable force under
General Cabañas, and Nicaragua prepared to do the
same if necessity required it. Guardiola's movement
was not seconded elsewhere. But he marched against
Nacaome, and at Pespire commissioners of Salvador
and Lindo made him understand his false position,
and an understanding was then had, on the 25th of
March, by which he submitted to Lindo's authority.<a name='FA_XV-17' id='FA_XV-17' href='#FN_XV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XV-17]</a>

<p class="sidenote">WAR AND TREATIES.</p>

<p class="p2">
The treaties of 1783 and 1786 between Great Britain
and Spain reserved to the latter the sovereignty over
Belize, otherwise called British Honduras, granting to
the settlers merely the privilege of cutting dye and
other woods,<a name='FA_XV-18' id='FA_XV-18' href='#FN_XV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XV-18]</a> using the spontaneous products of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
soil, fishing along the coast, repairing their vessels,
and building houses and stores. The colonists were
not to set up any government, either civil or military,
construct forts or defences, maintain troops of any
kind, or possess any artillery.<a name='FA_XV-19' id='FA_XV-19' href='#FN_XV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XV-19]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
BELIZE.
</p>

<p>
Governor O'Neill of Yucatan made an expedition
in 1798 against the English settlers during war between
the two nations, and destroyed a number of
settlements on the Rio Nuevo, but was afterward
repulsed by the colonists and slaves of Belize. This
circumstance was claimed to have given the victors
the right of conquest over the territory occupied by
them. But neither Spain, nor Mexico after her
independence, recognized that pretension, nor was it
admitted by the British parliament.<a name='FA_XV-20' id='FA_XV-20' href='#FN_XV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XV-20]</a> Furthermore,
the treaty signed in London, December 26, 1826, between
Great Britain and Mexico was negotiated on
the express condition that the treaty of July 14, 1786,
between the Spanish and British crowns should be
held valid and observed in all its provisions.<a name='FA_XV-21' id='FA_XV-21' href='#FN_XV-21' class='fnanchor'>[XV-21]</a> Therefore
the conclusion we must arrive at is, that the
sovereignty over Belize belongs to Mexico and not to
Great Britain. Mexico's claim has been recognized
by the settlers, when it suited their interests, but
they were never equally disposed to abide by the obligations
of the treaty of 1826.<a name='FA_XV-22' id='FA_XV-22' href='#FN_XV-22' class='fnanchor'>[XV-22]</a> Their encroachments
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
on Yucatan have continued to the extent that they now
hold much more than was conditionally allowed them
for wood-cutting by the treaty of 1783.<a name='FA_XV-23' id='FA_XV-23' href='#FN_XV-23' class='fnanchor'>[XV-23]</a>
</p>

<p>
Affecting to forget that they were entitled merely
to the usufruct of the country, the settlers set up as
early as 1798 a government,<a name='FA_XV-24' id='FA_XV-24' href='#FN_XV-24' class='fnanchor'>[XV-24]</a> raised troops, built forts,
tilled the soil, and exercised every right implying full
sovereignty. Alexander M'Donald, while holding the
office of superintendent,<a name='FA_XV-25' id='FA_XV-25' href='#FN_XV-25' class='fnanchor'>[XV-25]</a> on the 2d of November, 1840,
set aside the laws and usages of the country, declaring
that from said date the law of England should be the
law of the settlement or colony of British Honduras,
and that all local customs and laws repugnant to the
spirit of the law of England, and opposed to the principles
of equity and justice, should be null.<a name='FA_XV-26' id='FA_XV-26' href='#FN_XV-26' class='fnanchor'>[XV-26]</a> In later
years the government has been in the hands of a lieutenant-governor,
with an executive and legislative
council, and the colony has the usual judicial establishment.<a name='FA_XV-27' id='FA_XV-27' href='#FN_XV-27' class='fnanchor'>[XV-27]</a>

<p>
The assumption of sovereignty is not Mexico's only
cause of complaint. Since the war of races broke out
in Yucatan in 1847, the people of Belize have sold
arms and ammunition to the revolted Indians. Early
in 1848 the authorities promised that the Indians
should not be aided, directly or indirectly; but the
promise was not fulfilled.<a name='FA_XV-28' id='FA_XV-28' href='#FN_XV-28' class='fnanchor'>[XV-28]</a> The population is mainly
negro, originally introduced as slaves; the rest, excepting
a few white men, is a hybrid race resulting from
intercourse with Europeans and Indians. The total
population in 1871 was nearly 25,000, of which there
were probably 1,000 more males than females.<a name='FA_XV-29' id='FA_XV-29' href='#FN_XV-29' class='fnanchor'>[XV-29]</a> Slavery
was abolished by an act of the inhabitants on the
1st of August, 1840.<a name='FA_XV-30' id='FA_XV-30' href='#FN_XV-30' class='fnanchor'>[XV-30]</a>
</p>

<p>
The chief product of the country is mahogany, of
which some 20,000 tons were exported annually, but
the demand for it lately has decreased. Its logwood
is much valued, and about 15,000 tons are yearly exported.
Besides these staples, the country produces
other woods of value, and the cahoon or coyal palm
in abundance, from the nuts of which is extracted a
valuable oil. Sarsaparilla and vanilla are found in
the interior. Of domestic animals there are enough
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_317' name='Page_317' href='#Page_317'>317</a></span>
for the needs of the people. The colony during the
last fifteen or twenty years has been on the downward
course.

<p>
In former times the port of Belize was an entrepôt
for the neighboring states of Yucatan, Guatemala, and
Honduras,<a name='FA_XV-31' id='FA_XV-31' href='#FN_XV-31' class='fnanchor'>[XV-31]</a> but after the opening of direct trade between
those states and the United States and Europe,
and the diversion of trade on the Pacific to Panamá,
that source of prosperity ceased. Total tonnage
entered and cleared in 1877, exclusive of coasting
trade, 73,974, of which 46,168 were British. Value

ENGLISH COERCION.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The relations of Honduras with Great Britain were
during many years in an unsatisfactory state, due in a
great measure to the schemes of certain officials of the
latter government, who pushed ungrounded claims
against the former in the furtherance of their plans to
gain control of a large extent of the Central American
coast. On the 3d of October, 1849, a British war
ship at Trujillo demanded the sum of $111,061, alleged
to be due to subjects of her nation. The demand not
being complied with, an armed force was landed from
her the next day, which occupied the fort and town.
The British commander finally accepted on account
$1,200—all that the Honduran comandante could procure—and
on reëmbarking fired a volley.<a name='FA_XV-33' id='FA_XV-33' href='#FN_XV-33' class='fnanchor'>[XV-33]</a>

<p>
On the southern coast the British steamship <i>Gorgon</i>,
on the 16th of November, seized the island of Tiger,
hoisting the British flag at Amapala.<a name='FA_XV-34' id='FA_XV-34' href='#FN_XV-34' class='fnanchor'>[XV-34]</a> The authorities
of Honduras, after protesting against the act,
called the attention of the United States representative
to the British proceeding, for this island had been
ceded to his government in September previous.<a name='FA_XV-35' id='FA_XV-35' href='#FN_XV-35' class='fnanchor'>[XV-35]</a> It
is presumed that Chatfield's purpose, among other
things, was to prevent the construction of a canal
across Nicaragua by Americans. But Admiral
Hornby, commanding the British naval forces in the
Pacific, disapproved of the proceeding, removing his
men and restoring the Honduran flag under a salute
of twenty-one guns.<a name='FA_XV-36' id='FA_XV-36' href='#FN_XV-36' class='fnanchor'>[XV-36]</a>
</p>

<p>
A preliminary convention was entered into at San
José, Costa Rica, December 29, 1849, between Felipe
Jáuregui, calling himself commissioner of Honduras,
and Chatfield, the British chargé d'affaires, in nine
articles, some of which involved undue responsibility
on the part of Honduras.<a name='FA_XV-37' id='FA_XV-37' href='#FN_XV-37' class='fnanchor'>[XV-37]</a> This treaty was disavowed
by her government, March 22, 1850, in a note to
Admiral Hornby, declaring that Jáuregui had no
authority to make it, and its stipulations being offensive
to the dignity of the state, the legislature would
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>
never sanction them.<a name='FA_XV-38' id='FA_XV-38' href='#FN_XV-38' class='fnanchor'>[XV-38]</a> Meanwhile Honduras had
agreed with Chatfield to accredit a commissioner to
arrange with him for the settlement of British claims.
This was done; and the long and tedious question was
finally arranged on the 27th of March, 1852, Honduras
assuming an indebtedness of $80,000.<a name='FA_XV-39' id='FA_XV-39' href='#FN_XV-39' class='fnanchor'>[XV-39]</a>

FUTILE PROTESTS.
</p>

<p>
The debt question was not the only source of disquietude
for Honduras in her relations with Great
Britain. British officials, on trumped-up pretexts,
usurped and held, during several years, portions of her
territory. M'Donald, superintendent of Belize, occupied
Roatan and other islands belonging to Honduras
situated in the bay of this name. The Honduran
government protested against such usurpation, but no
attention was paid to its remonstrances. It does not
appear, however, that Great Britain was claiming
territorial rights over the Bay Islands, as they were
called.<a name='FA_XV-40' id='FA_XV-40' href='#FN_XV-40' class='fnanchor'>[XV-40]</a> Soon afterward, a number of Cayman
islanders settled in Roatan, and in the course of a
few years there were about 1,000, when the superintendent
of Belize found a pretext to assume the control.
In 1849, the islanders applied to Colonel Fancourt,
then superintendent of Belize, for a regular
government. He promised to comply with their
wishes, but was unable, and they continued choosing
their authorities. At last, in August 1850, the war
schooner <i>Bermuda</i>, Lieutenant Jolly commanding,
took formal possession of Roatan, Guanaja or Bonaca,
Utila, Barbarreta, Morat, Elena, etc., in behalf of the
British crown, declaring them a British appendage
under the name of Colony of the Bay Islands; against
which the acting chief magistrate, William Fitzgibbon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
protested on the 15th of September, 1850, in the
name of the sovereignty of Honduras.<a name='FA_XV-41' id='FA_XV-41' href='#FN_XV-41' class='fnanchor'>[XV-41]</a> The islands
were, in August 1852, under the rule of a lieutenant-governor.<a name='FA_XV-42' id='FA_XV-42' href='#FN_XV-42' class='fnanchor'>[XV-42]</a>
A treaty was finally concluded between
the queen of Great Britain and Honduras, on the 28th
of November, 1859, respecting the Bay Islands, the
Mosquito Indians, and the claims of British subjects,
which settled the question in favor of the latter
power.<a name='FA_XV-43' id='FA_XV-43' href='#FN_XV-43' class='fnanchor'>[XV-43]</a> Still one more trouble has occurred between
the two nations, in which the weaker one had to submit
to the demand of the other at the mouth of her
cannon. On the 19th of August, 1873, the war ship
<i>Niobe</i>, Sir Lambton Loraine commanding, bombarded
Fort San Fernando of Omoa.<a name='FA_XV-44' id='FA_XV-44' href='#FN_XV-44' class='fnanchor'>[XV-44]</a> The bombardment
ceased on the Honduran authorities agreeing to redress
the alleged grievances, and paying damages.<a name='FA_XV-45' id='FA_XV-45' href='#FN_XV-45' class='fnanchor'>[XV-45]</a> With
other nations of Europe and America—excepting

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
The boundary between Honduras and Nicaragua was
finally agreed upon in a convention dated September 1,

<p class="sidenote">PRESIDENT CABAÑAS.</p>

<p class="p2">
President Lindo, having been a third time elected
to the presidency for the term to begin February 1,
1852, published on the 25th of November, 1851, a
manifesto to the people, suggesting the expediency of
calling some other citizen to the executive chair,
pleading at the same time need of rest.<a name='FA_XV-48' id='FA_XV-48' href='#FN_XV-48' class='fnanchor'>[XV-48]</a> The people
took him at his word, and chose Trinidad Cabañas

on the 1st of March, 1852,<a name='FA_XV-49' id='FA_XV-49' href='#FN_XV-49' class='fnanchor'>[XV-49]</a> and on the next day in
his address to the assembly pledged his word to pursue
a liberal policy in observance of the principles that
had guided him throughout his career. His election
was hailed as an auspicious event, and a safeguard
against Guatemala's encroachments.<a name='FA_XV-50' id='FA_XV-50' href='#FN_XV-50' class='fnanchor'>[XV-50]</a> The state was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
at peace in the interior, and with the other states of
Central America, except Guatemala, with which the
relations were not harmonious, owing to the usurpation
by the latter of a portion of Honduran territory
on the Copan side. This, with divergence in political
principles between the two rulers, soon brought on a
bloody war,<a name='FA_XV-51' id='FA_XV-51' href='#FN_XV-51' class='fnanchor'>[XV-51]</a> which has been detailed in a previous
chapter.<a name='FA_XV-52' id='FA_XV-52' href='#FN_XV-52' class='fnanchor'>[XV-52]</a> The fruitlessness of this contest prompted
Salvador and Nicaragua to use their endeavors for
peace; but they proved unavailing. What Guatemala's
superior resources failed to accomplish on the field of
battle was, however, brought about by means of intrigue,
with the coöperation of the party opposed to
Cabañas in Honduras, headed by General Santos
Guardiola, which received efficacious aid from Carrera.
General Juan Lopez supported the revolutionary
movement with 700 men,<a name='FA_XV-53' id='FA_XV-53' href='#FN_XV-53' class='fnanchor'>[XV-53]</a> and Cabañas was overthrown
on the 6th of July, 1855.<a name='FA_XV-54' id='FA_XV-54' href='#FN_XV-54' class='fnanchor'>[XV-54]</a>
</p>

<p>
At last, being unable to cope with the daily increasing
forces of the enemy, he abandoned the field, and
retreated to Salvador. The serviles again took possession
of the government under Lopez.<a name='FA_XV-55' id='FA_XV-55' href='#FN_XV-55' class='fnanchor'>[XV-55]</a> The presidential
election took place amid this turmoil. The
state was divided into two factions, one supporting
Lindo and the other Guardiola. The friends of Lindo,
not feeling certain of success, proposed Lopez as a
compromise candidate, he being credited with the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_323' name='Page_323' href='#Page_323'>323</a></span>
expulsion of Cabañas, but finally abandoned the plan
and cast their votes for Guardiola, who assumed the
executive office, February 17, 1856, on his return
from Nicaragua, where he had been defeated by
William Walker. Lindo had meantime been in charge
of the government.<a name='FA_XV-56' id='FA_XV-56' href='#FN_XV-56' class='fnanchor'>[XV-56]</a> A system of despotism was now

POLITICAL DESPOTISM.

<p>
The country at this time was in a distressed condition.
Agriculture was neglected, most of the field
hands having emigrated. Business of all kinds was
at a stand-still. There was no available revenue, for
every one of its branches was burdened with debt.
The state had a contingent of troops serving in Nicaragua
against Walker, supported from a special forced
loan. To the credit of Guardiola's administration must
be recorded, however, that it secured peace with Guatemala,
and a settlement of questions pending with
Great Britain. At the end of his term he was reëlected.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_324' name='Page_324' href='#Page_324'>324</a></span>
Early in 1861 the government had a difference
with the vicario capitular. The see being then
vacant, this ecclesiastic assumed the right of excommunicating
the president, whom he accused of persecuting
the church; but the government forbade the
publication of his decree, and expelled its author from
the state.<a name='FA_XV-58' id='FA_XV-58' href='#FN_XV-58' class='fnanchor'>[XV-58]</a> This difficulty was subsequently arranged
through the metropolitan of Guatemala. Disturbances
occurred at various places,<a name='FA_XV-59' id='FA_XV-59' href='#FN_XV-59' class='fnanchor'>[XV-59]</a> which were brought to an
end in a short time. On the 11th of January, 1862,
the president was assassinated.<a name='FA_XV-60' id='FA_XV-60' href='#FN_XV-60' class='fnanchor'>[XV-60]</a> At first it was feared
that discord would reign again, and the other Central
American governments prepared to mediate in the
interests of peace.<a name='FA_XV-61' id='FA_XV-61' href='#FN_XV-61' class='fnanchor'>[XV-61]</a> Fortunately, good counsels prevailed,

BRIEF REIGNS.
</p>

<p>
Guardiola's constitutional successor, Victoriano Castellanos,
was in Salvador, and much against his will
was pushed by Barrios to accept the position. He
repaired to the frontier, and had the oath of office
administered to him by the alcalde of the little town
of Guarita; which was considered a strange proceeding
on his part by Senator José María Medina, who
had received the executive office from J. F. Montes,<a name='FA_XV-62' id='FA_XV-62' href='#FN_XV-62' class='fnanchor'>[XV-62]</a>
and invited him to the capital to enter upon his
duties.<a name='FA_XV-63' id='FA_XV-63' href='#FN_XV-63' class='fnanchor'>[XV-63]</a> Castellanos concluded soon after an alliance
offensive and defensive with Barrios, and at a time
when their states were at peace with the other governments
of Central America. This step, and the
diatribes of the press in Salvador and Honduras
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_325' name='Page_325' href='#Page_325'>325</a></span>
against the governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua,
paved the way for fresh troubles in Central America.
Castellanos held the government about ten months,
nearly all the time in a turmoil; and at his death was
temporarily succeeded by José Francisco Montes,
who followed in the footsteps of his predecessor, continuing
the alliance with Barrios, and hostilities against
Guatemala and Nicaragua. The serviles, assisted by
the troops of these two states, being victorious, overthrew
him, and on the 21st of June, 1863, placed at
the head of affairs, as provisional president of the
republic of Honduras, the senior senator, José María
Medina,<a name='FA_XV-64' id='FA_XV-64' href='#FN_XV-64' class='fnanchor'>[XV-64]</a> who issued a decree of outlawry against
Montes.<a name='FA_XV-65' id='FA_XV-65' href='#FN_XV-65' class='fnanchor'>[XV-65]</a> In December the capital was for a time
transferred to Gracias, and on the last day of the
same month Medina surrendered the executive office
to Francisco Inestroza.<a name='FA_XV-66' id='FA_XV-66' href='#FN_XV-66' class='fnanchor'>[XV-66]</a> On the 15th of February
of the following year, the presidential election took
place, and Medina and Florencio Xatruch appeared
to have obtained the popular suffrages, the former
for president and the latter for vice-president.<a name='FA_XV-67' id='FA_XV-67' href='#FN_XV-67' class='fnanchor'>[XV-67]</a>
</p>

<p>
Disturbances at Olancho were with little difficulty
brought to an end, the rebels being defeated at Tapescos.
A constituent assembly was convoked and met
to reform the constitution, which was done on the 19th
of September.<a name='FA_XV-68' id='FA_XV-68' href='#FN_XV-68' class='fnanchor'>[XV-68]</a> On the 29th of October, the constituent

<p>
Certain men of the United States, with ideas somewhat
warped in regard to the relative rights of humanity,
now come forward, as in the line of their destiny,
to interfere in the affairs of their neighbors. The
legitimist government of Nicaragua, in May 1855, felt
certain of ultimate triumph over its democratic opponents
at Leon. Circumstances seemed to point that
way, when the infusion of this foreign element at this
time came to defeat all preconceived plans.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DEFEAT AT RIVAS.
</p>

<p>
News arrived from the United States of the organization
in New York, Philadelphia, and Washington,
by H. L. Kinney, Fabens, American commercial agent
at San Juan del Norte, and others, of an expedition
ostensibly to establish a colony on the Mosquito Coast
for the purpose of developing its resources, but really
designed to overthrow the governments of Central
America, and usurp sovereignty over the whole country.<a name='FA_XVI-1' id='FA_XVI-1' href='#FN_XVI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-1]</a>
Remonstrances against the scheme were duly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
made to the American government, which partially
succeeded in their purpose. However, the project
was not exactly the source of the dire calamities that
were erelong to befall Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XVI-2' id='FA_XVI-2' href='#FN_XVI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-2]</a> The real danger
lay in another direction, to explain which I must go
back in my narrative to previous events. An American
named Byron Cole, who had conceived plans with
respect to Central America, and was well informed on
her affairs, arrived at Leon, in August 1854, when
the democratic leaders became convinced that they
could not take Granada. They entered into a contract
with him to bring an expedition of foreigners,
under the garb of colonists, who should receive grants
of land.<a name='FA_XVI-3' id='FA_XVI-3' href='#FN_XVI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-3]</a> Cole transferred his contract to William
Walker, who at once set to work in organizing the expedition.<a name='FA_XVI-4' id='FA_XVI-4' href='#FN_XVI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-4]</a>
He sailed from San Francisco, California,
May 4, 1855, on the brig <i>Vesta</i>, with 58 men,<a name='FA_XVI-5' id='FA_XVI-5' href='#FN_XVI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-5]</a> touched
at Amapala to meet Captain Morton, Castellon's
agent, and on the 13th of June reached Realejo, where
he received the greetings of the government he was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
to serve from Lieutenant-colonel Félix Ramirez.<a name='FA_XVI-6' id='FA_XVI-6' href='#FN_XVI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-6]</a> At
Leon he refused to serve under General Muñoz.<a name='FA_XVI-7' id='FA_XVI-7' href='#FN_XVI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-7]</a> He
was made a colonel of the Nicaraguan army, and with
55 foreigners and 100 natives was despatched to the
department of Rivas, having in his company colonels
Ramirez and Mendez, and Máximo Espinosa, the last-named
going there as prefect. Muñoz at once informed
Corral of the movement, and the town of Rivas was
reënforced and prepared for defence. Walker obtained
some advantages at first, on the 29th of June, but
being assailed on his left by Colonel Argüello, his
foreigners were dispersed, and Ramirez' native force
fled, and entered Costa Rican territory.<a name='FA_XVI-8' id='FA_XVI-8' href='#FN_XVI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-8]</a> Walker and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
his phalanx reached San Juan del Sur, whence they
returned to Realejo on the brig <i>San José</i>;<a name='FA_XVI-9' id='FA_XVI-9' href='#FN_XVI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-9]</a> and shortly
after, Estrada, the legitimist president, went to Managua
in June, staying there until early in July, when the
first cases of cholera occurred.<a name='FA_XVI-10' id='FA_XVI-10' href='#FN_XVI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-10]</a> The mortality in
Managua from the epidemic was greater than in any
other town, owing to the concentration of troops there.
The army which had been organized for assailing Leon
was destroyed within a few days; and only a small
body of officers of all grades, some of them in a dying
condition, transferred themselves to Granada, entirely
abandoning Managua. The epidemic was still doing
its work, when the action of El Sauce took place on
the 18th of August, between forces respectively commanded
by Guardiola and Muñoz, in which the former
were defeated, and abandoned the place to their assailants;
but just as success was crowning democratic
efforts, Muñoz was killed by a bullet entering his side.<a name='FA_XVI-11' id='FA_XVI-11' href='#FN_XVI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-11]</a>
The victors, now under Colonel Sarría, did not pursue
the enemy, but resolutely countermarched to Leon,
and meeting Jerez on the road, who wished to lead
them against the legitimists, they refused to follow
him.

<p class="sidenote">
SAN JUAN DEL SUR EXPEDITION.
</p>

<p>
Another expedition under Walker, composed of 50
foreigners and 120 natives, whose immediate chief was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_331' name='Page_331' href='#Page_331'>331</a></span>
J. M. Valle, alias El Chelon, sailed from Realejo on
the 23d of August, and landed at San Juan del Sur
on the 29th, his main object being to take up a position
on the transit route between the two oceans.
The news of his landing reached Granada on Guardiola's
return from his ill-fated fight at El Sauce.
Guardiola went to Rivas, and assuming command of
500 men, in the night between the 2d and 3d of September,
marched against Walker. Once on the main
road he heard that the latter had gone to La Vírgen,
on Lake Nicaragua, and rapidly countermarched to
that place, expecting to surprise the enemy. But he
made the mistake of attacking an opponent whom he
could not see, and in a little while his men became
dispersed, and hurried back to Rivas. This may be
said to have been the end of Guardiola's career in
Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XVI-12' id='FA_XVI-12' href='#FN_XVI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-12]</a> Corral was now placed in command of
the legitimist forces in the south.
</p>

<p>
Castellon, the head of the democratic government,
died of cholera on the 2d of September, and Senator
Nazario Escoto was called to succeed him.
</p>

<p>
Walker's force, after his victory at La Vírgen,
became greatly augmented with native democrats.<a name='FA_XVI-13' id='FA_XVI-13' href='#FN_XVI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-13]</a>
His movement on La Vírgen was intended to show
that he had a sufficient force to take the offensive.
After the action he returned to San Juan del Sur,
where he received from Corral a paper hinting at a
desire to enter into confidential relations with him, to
which he paid no attention. His plan was to make a
dash upon and occupy the legitimist seat of government,
the battered city of Granada.<a name='FA_XVI-14' id='FA_XVI-14' href='#FN_XVI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-14]</a> In furtherance

of which Espinosa was despatched to Leon to ask the
government for a diversion toward Managua, so as to
draw resources away from Granada. General Pineda
was accordingly stationed with a respectable force in
Pueblo Nuevo. The legitimists, under General Hernandez,
attacked Pineda on the 11th of October, defeated
and drove him out of the place, after which he
demanded of the government at Leon the surrender
of the town, together with its garrison and military
stores, as the only means of averting the bloodshed
which must follow any attempt at resistance. The
democrats suffered reverse, but Walker gained his
point. Granada was left with a weak garrison. He
had a force of 250 natives and about 80 Americans,
with which he left San Juan at daybreak on the 11th
of October, arriving at La Vírgen early the same
morning. In the afternoon Colonel Hornsby seized
the steamboat <i>Vírgen</i>, and the next morning the
troops were embarked and informed that their destination
was Granada. They effected a landing at 3
o'clock in the morning of the 13th, and took Granada
with little resistance from the insignificant civic guard
which constituted the garrison.<a name='FA_XVI-15' id='FA_XVI-15' href='#FN_XVI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-15]</a> The place was
taken before a majority of the inhabitants knew who
their visitors were. President Estrada, and the ministers
Nicasio Castillo and Francisco Barberena, saved
themselves on foot in different directions, which
the other ministers, Mayorga and Ruiz, failed to do.
The fact is, that persons who did not get away at the
moment of the invasion found themselves unable to
do so, and at the mercy of the enemy. Walker, however,
checked the abuses of his soldiery, and liberated
nearly 100 political prisoners, who had been kept in
chains and at hard labor, and who now joined his
banner to a man. He next issued a proclamation
guaranteeing the lives, liberty, and property of legitimists
promising to be peaceable.<a name='FA_XVI-16' id='FA_XVI-16' href='#FN_XVI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-16]</a>

Corral, who had prepared five hundred men for an
attempt to recover Granada. Juan J. Ruiz, Estrada's
minister of war, was despatched by water in company
with John H. Wheeler, the American minister, to
convey a message to Corral at Rivas; but on finding
that the legitimist general had gone off to the eastern
department, he escaped into Costa Rica. Another
commission went by land, and meeting the legitimist
army near Nandaime, communicated to the general
Walker's message to this effect: peace, on the condition
that the two leaders should govern the republic,
Corral as president, and Walker as commander of the
forces.<a name='FA_XVI-17' id='FA_XVI-17' href='#FN_XVI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-17]</a> The proposition was not accepted. The expedition
which had been prepared for an effort to recuperate
Granada finally went to Masaya, where the
legitimist government became organized, with President
Estrada, and his ministers, Castillo and Barberena.

ASCENDENCY OF THE FILIBUSTER.

<p>
The officers who had won the victory at Pueblo
Nuevo, fearing that their country would become a
prey to the foreign adventurers, proposed to Escoto's
government a fusion of the parties, to drive Walker
and his myrmidons out of the country. This effort
failed.<a name='FA_XVI-18' id='FA_XVI-18' href='#FN_XVI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-18]</a> Walker and Valle, for their successful campaign
in the south, were on the 22d of October promoted
to brigadier-general. The first named, angered
by Corral's refusal to accept his proposals, and ignoring
his own pledges to the prisoners taken at Granada,
reduced to close confinement some of the most prominent,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_334' name='Page_334' href='#Page_334'>334</a></span>
among them the ex-minister Mayorga,<a name='FA_XVI-19' id='FA_XVI-19' href='#FN_XVI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-19]</a> whereupon
a commission, composed of the Frenchman Pierre
Rouhaud of Granada, and Fermin Arana, represented
to Corral the necessity of his coming to amicable
arrangement with Walker, but he declined a second
time. Meanwhile an incident occurred which greatly
aggravated the evils of the situation. Parker H.
French<a name='FA_XVI-20' id='FA_XVI-20' href='#FN_XVI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-20]</a> brought fifty men to Walker from California,
who, under a so-called Colonel Fry, were to capture
Fort San Cárlos, which they failed to do. The steamer
then returned to Granada to leave the recruits, and to
La Vírgen to land the rest of the passengers. This
was done just as some legitimist troops, under Captain
F. Gutierrez, arrived. Gutierrez asserted that he had
been fired upon from the house of the Transit company,
and returned the fire, keeping it up till hostilities
from the other side ceased. The result was, that
two or three passengers from the United States were
killed. The San Cárlos also fired shots at the river
steamer on her return from the north with passengers,
a gun killing a woman and child.<a name='FA_XVI-21' id='FA_XVI-21' href='#FN_XVI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-21]</a> This news reached
Granada together with Corral's second refusal. Walker
then resolved upon retaliation, to avenge the slain of
San Cárlos and La Vírgen, and to frighten the legitimists
into accepting terms of compromise. Mayorga,
a young man of twenty-nine, generally esteemed for
his fine qualities, was the chosen victim, and shot in
the morning of the 23d.<a name='FA_XVI-22' id='FA_XVI-22' href='#FN_XVI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-22]</a> Rouhaud and Arana went
on the 22d to Masaya, reporting Mayorga's fate, and
urging the absolute necessity of disarming Walker's
wrath to avert greater calamities.<a name='FA_XVI-23' id='FA_XVI-23' href='#FN_XVI-23' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-23]</a> Added to their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_335' name='Page_335' href='#Page_335'>335</a></span>
statement was a petition from the prisoners in favor
of peace, and the alarming news that four hundred
more riflemen had arrived to swell Walker's army.
The legitimist authorities concluded then to negotiate
for peace, and sent Corral to Granada on the 23d for
that purpose, which was tantamount to a capitulation.
The chief clauses agreed upon between him and Walker
were: suspension of hostilities; recognition of Patricio
Rivas as provisional president; and reorganization of
the two contending forces into one army, with Walker
as its commander-in-chief.<a name='FA_XVI-24' id='FA_XVI-24' href='#FN_XVI-24' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-24]</a> Corral returned to Masaya,
and Estrada, submitting to the force of circumstances,
approved it, though his army was disposed to
disregard the capitulation.<a name='FA_XVI-25' id='FA_XVI-25' href='#FN_XVI-25' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-25]</a> However, he filed a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_336' name='Page_336' href='#Page_336'>336</a></span>
protest declaring that the arrangement had been forced
upon him, and therefore void.<a name='FA_XVI-26' id='FA_XVI-26' href='#FN_XVI-26' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-26]</a> He called on the
other governments to come, without further invitation,
and save the independence, sovereignty, and liberties
of Nicaragua; and to that effect appointed
commissioners with unlimited powers<a name='FA_XVI-27' id='FA_XVI-27' href='#FN_XVI-27' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-27]</a> to conclude
adequate treaties. The fall of Cabañas in Honduras
opened an opportunity in that direction. Estrada dissolved
his government October 28th, and departed for
Chontales, but soon after had to take refuge in Honduras.

MURDEROUS PROCEEDINGS.
</p>

<p>
Fermin Ferrer and Valle, alias El Chelon, were despatched
as commissioners to obtain the assent of the
government at Leon to the convention of October 23d,
which, in view of Walkers rebellion, was given only
after some hesitation.<a name='FA_XVI-28' id='FA_XVI-28' href='#FN_XVI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-28]</a> A commission was despatched
to Walker to thank him for his services, which had
made possible a peace, and to authorize him to ratify
the arrangement. After which the government, October
28th, dissolved itself. The commissioners<a name='FA_XVI-29' id='FA_XVI-29' href='#FN_XVI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-29]</a> arrived
at Granada on the 31st, and found there the provisional
president, Patricio Rivas,<a name='FA_XVI-30' id='FA_XVI-30' href='#FN_XVI-30' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-30]</a> who had arrived
from San Juan del Norte on the 30th, and occupied
the presidential chair. He had at first appointed
Corral minister of war, Walker general of division
and in chief of the forces, and Norberto Ramirez
minister of relations. Corral was pleased with this
arrangement, as Rivas was disposed to rely on him; but
Walker became suspicious, and the result was that,
Corral's opposition notwithstanding, Rivas was made
a blind tool of Walker, and in obedience to orders appointed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_337' name='Page_337' href='#Page_337'>337</a></span>
a new cabinet with a majority of democrats;
namely, Máximo Jerez, of relations; Fermin Ferrer,
of public credit; Parker H. French, of the treasury;
Corral retaining the war portfolio. The latter now
saw the abyss his weakness had thrown him into.
The man who, ignoring the duty he owed his cause,
threatened with death any one proposing to him plans
against Walker, now writes Martinez, comandante at
Managua, that all is lost, and he, Martinez, must take
some steps to save the country. With this letter were
enclosed others to the same effect addressed to generals
Guardiola and Pedro Xatruch, who had returned to
Honduras.<a name='FA_XVI-31' id='FA_XVI-31' href='#FN_XVI-31' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-31]</a> These letters went into the hands of
Walker,<a name='FA_XVI-32' id='FA_XVI-32' href='#FN_XVI-32' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-32]</a> who at once called to his presence the legitimists
then in the city to forbid the departure of any of
them, and laid the letters before Rivas and his cabinet.
Corral acknowledged the authorship, declaring that
he was solely responsible for them. It was then decided
to confine in prison Corral and his chief supporters.
This was on the 5th of November, the day
after Corral's troops had been, without any previous
notice, disarmed.<a name='FA_XVI-33' id='FA_XVI-33' href='#FN_XVI-33' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-33]</a> On the 6th, it was decreed that
Corral should be dealt with as a traitor and tried by
court-martial, which was done in the presence and
with the approval of the government, notwithstanding
its illegality.<a name='FA_XVI-34' id='FA_XVI-34' href='#FN_XVI-34' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-34]</a> The trial took place, and the prisoner
was sentenced to death.<a name='FA_XVI-35' id='FA_XVI-35' href='#FN_XVI-35' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-35]</a> The prisoner's family used
the utmost exertions to have the sentence revoked,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_338' name='Page_338' href='#Page_338'>338</a></span>
but Walker was inflexible, and the penalty was inflicted
on the 8th of November,<a name='FA_XVI-36' id='FA_XVI-36' href='#FN_XVI-36' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-36]</a> causing the utmost consternation
in the native community. The portfolio
of war was given to Selva by a decree of November
5th. Valle went to Managua to place Pascual Fonseca
in command, vice Martinez, and to report if the
latter made any resistance, in which event Walker
would have shot his legitimist prisoners. But as none
was offered, Martinez having had timely warning,
Walker had them released.<a name='FA_XVI-37' id='FA_XVI-37' href='#FN_XVI-37' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-37]</a>
</p>

<p>
Walker was now master of Nicaragua. As a
matter of fact, the secondary leaders were scattered
and powerless, and but for the execution of Corral,
and the wanton imprisonment of subordinate officials
and private citizens, the conservative party would
have submitted with a good grace to the new order of
things, if pledged security of life and property. It is
undeniable that the legitimists feared the Yankees<a name='FA_XVI-38' id='FA_XVI-38' href='#FN_XVI-38' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-38]</a>
less than they did the native democrats. Walker pretended
a great respect for religion, without whose
support, he said, no government could have stability.<a name='FA_XVI-39' id='FA_XVI-39' href='#FN_XVI-39' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-39]</a>
He succeeded in borrowing from the vicar 963 ounces
of fine silver belonging to the church; and it is evident
that he placed great reliance on a numerous
foreign immigration to keep his ranks well filled.<a name='FA_XVI-40' id='FA_XVI-40' href='#FN_XVI-40' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-40]</a> A
decree was issued at this time by the government,
and published in its official journal, which might be
called one for the confiscation of the property of absentees,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_339' name='Page_339' href='#Page_339'>339</a></span>
who were required to return to their homes

RELATIONS, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN.
</p>

<p>
The exiles who reached Honduras<a name='FA_XVI-42' id='FA_XVI-42' href='#FN_XVI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-42]</a> endeavored to
obtain help from the government, but Guardiola, now
chief of the state, declined giving any, and in fact
permitted no hostile words against Walker or the
Yankees. Cabañas had come to Granada for aid to
recover his lost position,<a name='FA_XVI-43' id='FA_XVI-43' href='#FN_XVI-43' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-43]</a> which alarmed Guardiola,
who despatched Manuel Colindres with the ostensible
mission of negotiating a treaty of friendship with the
government, but really to watch Cabañas. Colindres
announced himself from Yuscaran, but on reaching
Leon, and ascertaining that Cabañas got no assistance,
went back pleading fear of the cholera, which was
doing havoc in the foreign force; but the recognition
by his government was already accomplished. The
cabinet of San Salvador also returned a satisfactory
answer to a circular from Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XVI-44' id='FA_XVI-44' href='#FN_XVI-44' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-44]</a> Guatemala
apparently inclined toward neutrality, until Estrada
applied to Carrera for assistance, and was told that
he would be recognized as the legitimate president of
Nicaragua, but must first establish his government
somewhere.<a name='FA_XVI-45' id='FA_XVI-45' href='#FN_XVI-45' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-45]</a> Estrada, being unable to set it up in
Honduras, asked for 50 men to escort him to Nueva
Segovia in Nicaragua, but did not get them, though
he laid before Guardiola the letters from Carrera and
Pedro de Aycinena. In Costa Rica, the situation of
Nicaragua was differently viewed. President Mora
despatched Nazario Toledo to Guatemala to arrange
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_340' name='Page_340' href='#Page_340'>340</a></span>
for concerted action against Walker.<a name='FA_XVI-46' id='FA_XVI-46' href='#FN_XVI-46' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-46]</a> Mora in an
energetic proclamation asked the people to prepare for
the defence of their lives and property at a moment's
call.<a name='FA_XVI-47' id='FA_XVI-47' href='#FN_XVI-47' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-47]</a> Walker watched the conduct of Costa Rica,
believing it prompted by British influence mainly
against the United States. Rivas' relations with the
cabinet of Washington were not encouraging. It is true
that Wheeler, the American minister, had prematurely
recognized him, but he had not been upheld in it by his
government. Parker H. French, being accredited in
November 1855 as minister at Washington with powers
to negotiate a treaty, was not received in any diplomatic
capacity.<a name='FA_XVI-48' id='FA_XVI-48' href='#FN_XVI-48' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-48]</a> He was thereupon recalled, and
diplomatic relations were discontinued with Wheeler.<a name='FA_XVI-49' id='FA_XVI-49' href='#FN_XVI-49' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-49]</a>
President Pierce issued a proclamation against the
departure from the United States of filibustering expeditions,
which were declared disgraceful and criminal.
Cabañas, in whose behalf Jerez had used his best endeavors,
having been refused by the government any
aid,<a name='FA_XVI-50' id='FA_XVI-50' href='#FN_XVI-50' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-50]</a> retired to Salvador,<a name='FA_XVI-51' id='FA_XVI-51' href='#FN_XVI-51' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-51]</a> and Jerez resigned his portfolio
on the 8th of January, 1856. Soon after, the
cabinet was reduced to one, Fermin Ferrer, who
served as ministro general.
</p>

<p>
Walker now endeavored to gain the good-will and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_341' name='Page_341' href='#Page_341'>341</a></span>
coöperation of the legitimist party, but his intrigues,
cajolings, and even threats failed to secure the desired
effect.<a name='FA_XVI-52' id='FA_XVI-52' href='#FN_XVI-52' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-52]</a> The legitimists saw in Walker's disagreement
with the democrats their opportunity to bring
about the fusion of all Nicaraguans against the common
enemy; but both Walker and the democrats concluded
that they must work together for their mutual
safety; hence the removal of the capital to Leon.<a name='FA_XVI-53' id='FA_XVI-53' href='#FN_XVI-53' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-53]</a>

SEIZURE OF STEAMSHIP PROPERTY.

<p>
Walker now committed one of the greatest blunders
of his life in quarrelling with the founders and chief
men of the Accessory Transit Company, whose ships
had brought him much to recruit his needed men
and military supplies.<a name='FA_XVI-54' id='FA_XVI-54' href='#FN_XVI-54' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-54]</a> He and Edmund Randolph,
after studying the company's contracts made in 1851,
arrived at the conclusion that there were good reasons
to revoke their charter and acts of incorporation, and
to make a grant to other parties.<a name='FA_XVI-55' id='FA_XVI-55' href='#FN_XVI-55' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-55]</a> This was secretly
done without communicating their plans to President
Rivas or his cabinet. After completing their arrangements
in New York, Walker and Randolph drew up
a decree suppressing the Accessory Transit Company,
which was laid before Rivas, who issued it on the
18th of February, 1856. On the following day he, in
obedience to Walker's command, signed a new charter
in favor of Randolph.<a name='FA_XVI-56' id='FA_XVI-56' href='#FN_XVI-56' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-56]</a> Cleto Mayorga, E. T. C.
Kewen, and George F. Alden were appointed commissioners
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_342' name='Page_342' href='#Page_342'>342</a></span>
to ascertain the amount of the company's indebtedness,
and to attach their property, all of which
was done with the utmost rapidity.<a name='FA_XVI-57' id='FA_XVI-57' href='#FN_XVI-57' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-57]</a> The transportation
men raised a loud cry, of course, calling upon the
United States government to recover their lake steamers
and other valuables; but the attempt was unsuccessful.
The company, however, had means which
they brought into the service of the Central Americans
to compass the destruction of Walker.

<p>
Costa Rica had failed to notice the communication
notifying her of the new order of things established
in Nicaragua on the 23d of October, 1855. Walker
now thought the time had come to demand from that
cabinet a frank explanation of its course.<a name='FA_XVI-58' id='FA_XVI-58' href='#FN_XVI-58' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-58]</a> But it
persisted in leaving unanswered the Nicaraguan notes,
and refused to receive Louis Schlessinger, the envoy
sent, who retired threatening war and Walker's resentment.<a name='FA_XVI-59' id='FA_XVI-59' href='#FN_XVI-59' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-59]</a>
Costa Rica accepted the challenge of war,
President Mora, with the authorization of the legislative
body, resolving to carry the arms of the republic
into Nicaragua, and to aid in driving out the foreigners.
War was accordingly declared, the strength of the
army raised to 9,000 men, and a loan levied for expenses.<a name='FA_XVI-60' id='FA_XVI-60' href='#FN_XVI-60' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-60]</a>
After surrendering the executive office to
Vice-president Oreamuno, Mora placed himself, on
the 8th of March, at the head of an army about
3,000 strong,<a name='FA_XVI-61' id='FA_XVI-61' href='#FN_XVI-61' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-61]</a> and in a few days was in Bagaces, at
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_343' name='Page_343' href='#Page_343'>343</a></span>
the extreme end of the gulf of Nicoya, ready to cross
the frontier into Nicaragua. Walker, who seemed
to misjudge Costa Rican prowess, sent only 500 men
under Schlessinger, who on the 20th<a name='FA_XVI-62' id='FA_XVI-62' href='#FN_XVI-62' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-62]</a> encountered
the enemy's avant guard, and after a few minutes'

and several killed and wounded.<a name='FA_XVI-63' id='FA_XVI-63' href='#FN_XVI-63' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-63]</a> A number of prisoners

COSTA RICA TO THE RESCUE.

<p>
The Costa Ricans marched to Rivas, and as they
approached Walker retired on the Transit company's
lake steamers to Granada. Two columns of 300 each
dislodged on the 7th of April the Nicaraguan garrisons
left by Walker in La Vírgen and San Juan del
Sur, and on the following day the rest of the army
occupied Rivas. But Walker soon came upon them.
Under cover of the thick plantain and cacao plantations,
he entered unperceived in the morning of
the 11th. His attack began about 8:30 and lasted
till night. He captured the main plaza, and from
the church and houses kept up a deadly fire on
the enemy, stationed only two blocks away. The
latter fought desperately, till Walker, finding himself
closely pressed by Costa Rican reënforcements from
La Vírgen and San Juan del Sur,<a name='FA_XVI-66' id='FA_XVI-66' href='#FN_XVI-66' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-66]</a> and surrounded
by burning buildings, gave orders for retreat, which
was silently effected under cover of the darkness,
never tarrying till he reached the Gil Gonzalez River.
He left behind a considerable number of rifles, revolvers,
and other arms, and about 50 saddled horses,
besides his seriously wounded in the church. The
Costa Rican victory was complete, though at the
expense of heavy casualties.<a name='FA_XVI-67' id='FA_XVI-67' href='#FN_XVI-67' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-67]</a> The victors were relentless

toward the first prisoners that fell into their
hands. According to Mora's report, the wounded in
the church were bayoneted, and seventeen others
shot. Walker tried to make out that he had won a
great victory, and the event was celebrated in Granada
with salutes and ringing of bells; and his government
published that the Costa Ricans had been dispersed
and were in full flight.<a name='FA_XVI-68' id='FA_XVI-68' href='#FN_XVI-68' class='fnanchor'>[XVI-68]</a>

UNSTABLE POWER OF THE PIRATE.

<p>
Mora expected heavy reënforcements from Punta
Arenas, and had formed the plan, after securing
eastern Nicaragua between the Pacific and the great
lake, and cutting off the transit communication,
already suspended by a general order, to assail
Walker in his stronghold of Granada. He was further
encouraged in this by news that forces of Salvador
and Honduras were already on the western frontier,
under Belloso and Xatruch, ready to coöperate
with him. But the breaking out of cholera in his
army, with terrible havoc in its ranks, necessitated the
abandonment of the project for the time. And a report
having come of plottings in Costa Rica against
his authority, with his brother José Joaquin and his
personal staff, he returned home, leaving General
Cañas in command of the remnants of the army, with
orders to send it back to Costa Rica in the most convenient
manner, which was done, many of the men
being left dead or dying on the march. Cañas found
it unavoidable to leave his wounded and sick in Rivas,
and fearing retaliation because of the executions of
prisoners at Santa Rosa and Rivas, he wrote Walker
on the 26th of April, recommending these men to his
protection, and proposing an exchange of prisoners, of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_346' name='Page_346' href='#Page_346'></a></span>

<p>
After the departure of the Costa Rican forces
from Rivas, toward the end of April or beginning of
May 1856, Walker visited the town, treating harshly
the principal citizens—men who loved their country
better than they loved designing interlopers—and causing
one to be hanged.<a name='FA_XVII-1' id='FA_XVII-1' href='#FN_XVII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-1]</a> This was done to terrify his
enemies. Leaving Hornsby as military governor, with
a garrison, Walker went back to Granada. His army
here was also being decimated by the epidemic,
but its ranks were replenished from the passengers
brought by the steamships, which still were his efficacious
auxiliaries. Meanwhile the presence of the combined
forces of the other states in the west was felt
in the towns of the western departments, chiefly in
Chontales and Matagalpa,<a name='FA_XVII-2' id='FA_XVII-2' href='#FN_XVII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-2]</a> the natives yearning for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_348' name='Page_348' href='#Page_348'>348</a></span>
relief from foreign domination. A meeting of military
officers held on the 20th of April at Matagalpa,
and presided over by General Fernando Chamorro,
adopted resolutions in favor of restoring Estrada as
the legitimate president.<a name='FA_XVII-3' id='FA_XVII-3' href='#FN_XVII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-3]</a> This movement came to
naught; Chamorro, being defeated, passed into Honduras.
</p>

<p>
The democratic party, desirous as much as possible
of being away from Walker's oppressive influence, had
the government seat removed to Leon.<a name='FA_XVII-4' id='FA_XVII-4' href='#FN_XVII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-4]</a> The general
started from Granada May 31st with his best officers
and 300 infantry, for Leon, where he was greeted as
a conquering hero.<a name='FA_XVII-5' id='FA_XVII-5' href='#FN_XVII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-5]</a> While there he approved of, or
maybe prompted, the decree of June 10th, convoking
congress, and for the election of a chief magistrate.
He had in view to bring about his own election as
president, intending after that to throw off his democratic
friends, whose loyalty he distrusted. Very satisfactory
news, both to him and the government, came
at this time. The government of the United States
had recognized Father Agustin Vigil as minister
plenipotentiary accredited at Washington by Rivas.
This recognition was of great advantage to Walker.<a name='FA_XVII-6' id='FA_XVII-6' href='#FN_XVII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-6]</a>

DISSENSIONS.
</p>

<p>
On the 11th, after Walker had departed on his
return to Granada, leaving Colonel Bruno Naztmer
in command, this officer ordered foreign soldiers to
take the place of the natives in the steeples of the
cathedral. Minister of war Jerez countermanded it,
and being disobeyed by Naztmer,<a name='FA_XVII-7' id='FA_XVII-7' href='#FN_XVII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-7]</a> the government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_349' name='Page_349' href='#Page_349'>349</a></span>
became much alarmed, Rivas and Jerez starting
forthwith for Chinandega,<a name='FA_XVII-8' id='FA_XVII-8' href='#FN_XVII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-8]</a> whence Walker was directed
to concentrate the foreign forces in Granada.
Upon hearing at Masaya of the occurrences of
the 11th and 12th, he countermarched as far as
Nagarote, ordering Naztmer to bring there his command;
after which he quartered his troops in Granada,
placing, however, strong garrisons in Managua
and Masaya. Rivas thereupon declared Walker a
usurper, traitor, and enemy of the republic, depriving
him of his rank and command.<a name='FA_XVII-9' id='FA_XVII-9' href='#FN_XVII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-9]</a> Walker, on his part,
deposed Rivas, calling Fermin Ferrer, minister of
hacienda and government at Granada, who had identified
himself with his cause, to assume the executive
office, for the main purpose, it seemed, of decreeing an
election for supreme authorities, pursuant to the convocation
of June 10th, though Rivas had revoked it
on the 14th.<a name='FA_XVII-10' id='FA_XVII-10' href='#FN_XVII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-10]</a>

<p>
Under the national constitution, the chief magistrate
was not chosen by the direct suffrages of the people;
neither did it permit a military officer in actual command,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_350' name='Page_350' href='#Page_350'>350</a></span>
much less a foreign one, to be voted for.
Nevertheless, in disregard of that law, the people of
the region controlled by Walker's bayonets were
made to give him their suffrages for the office of president,
and 15,835 votes appeared as cast in his favor.<a name='FA_XVII-11' id='FA_XVII-11' href='#FN_XVII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-11]</a>
He was declared elected, and on the 12th of July was
inducted into office with much pomp.<a name='FA_XVII-12' id='FA_XVII-12' href='#FN_XVII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-12]</a> Wheeler, the
American minister, recognized Walker as the legitimate
president, and Rivas' government protested
against it,<a name='FA_XVII-13' id='FA_XVII-13' href='#FN_XVII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-13]</a> and declared all relations between the
Nicaraguan government and Wheeler suspended.
</p>

<p>
Walker's first act was to appoint his cabinet, the
chief of it being Fermin Ferrer.<a name='FA_XVII-14' id='FA_XVII-14' href='#FN_XVII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-14]</a> One of his earliest
decrees sounds the keynote to all this silly usurpation
and accompanying infamy; it was the annulling of the
federal law abolishing slavery.<a name='FA_XVII-15' id='FA_XVII-15' href='#FN_XVII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-15]</a> Another infamous
measure was the confiscation of the estates of Nicaraguans
who might take up arms against him.
</p>

<p>
In a circular of July 3d Rivas appealed to the other
Central American governments for aid to drive out
the invaders. The call was answered, and his government
recognized by Guatemala, Honduras, and Salvador,
these three powers agreeing to unite their
forces against Walker. Costa Rica was invited to
coöperate, and promptly did so.<a name='FA_XVII-16' id='FA_XVII-16' href='#FN_XVII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-16]</a>

DEFEAT OF THE LEGITIMISTS.

<p>
While the events thus far recorded were occurring,
Estrada, the legitimist chief, entered Nicaragua, and
established his government in Somotillo, appointing
Pedro Joaquin Chamorro his minister-general, and
General Tomás Martinez commander of the army to
be raised.<a name='FA_XVII-17' id='FA_XVII-17' href='#FN_XVII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-17]</a> On hearing that Rivas had been recognized,
it was concluded to leave Somotillo, via Nueva
Segovia to Matagalpa, where Gros aroused the Indians.
But on the way, at Ocotal, on the 13th of August,
a party of democrats attacked and defeated them.
Estrada tried to flee, but was overtaken and hacked
to death.<a name='FA_XVII-18' id='FA_XVII-18' href='#FN_XVII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-18]</a> The town was plundered, and papers scattered,
after which the assailants went away. Afterward
an instrument was picked up in which Nicasio
del Castillo was named Estrada's successor, who at
once assumed the responsibilities of the position.
However, General Martinez and Fernando Guzman,
who, though respecting Estrada's good motives, had
disapproved of his persistence in going contrary to accomplished
facts, after his death held a consultation
and concluded that the best policy was to coöperate
with Rivas' government, bearing in mind the principle
of legitimacy, though disregarding means and persons.
Martinez and Guzman went to Leon, and succeeded
with the assistance of the allied generals, and Gregorio
Arbizú, the commissioner of Salvador, in making an
arrangement by which there should be but one government
in the republic, with certain legitimists in the
cabinet;<a name='FA_XVII-19' id='FA_XVII-19' href='#FN_XVII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-19]</a> pursuant to which the latter was organized

The allied forces, having entered Nicaragua, occupied
Leon in July, and in October advanced upon

near Nindirí and Masaya, to reconcentrate in Granada.<a name='FA_XVII-21' id='FA_XVII-21' href='#FN_XVII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-21]</a>
Masaya was occupied by the allies October 2d.
There was much division among them, owing to old
rivalries, and the need of an influential commander
was evident.<a name='FA_XVII-22' id='FA_XVII-22' href='#FN_XVII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-22]</a> General Martinez was earnestly requested
to hasten his movements and join the army.
He had organized at Matagalpa a body of troops that
subsequently bore the name of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Ejército Septentrional</span>,
with which he came on; but cholera having played
havoc among his Segovians at Tipitapa, he had to remain

THE BELLIGERENTS IN ACTION.
</p>

<p>
Walker's forces consisted of about 1,200 effective
men, mostly Americans, the rest being English, French,
and Germans.<a name='FA_XVII-24' id='FA_XVII-24' href='#FN_XVII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-24]</a> The climate was his worst enemy.
A number of his men succumbed daily, victims of
cholera and fever.<a name='FA_XVII-25' id='FA_XVII-25' href='#FN_XVII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-25]</a> The ranks were further depleted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_353' name='Page_353' href='#Page_353'>353</a></span>
by desertions.<a name='FA_XVII-26' id='FA_XVII-26' href='#FN_XVII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-26]</a> This was one of the chief reasons
why Walker abandoned Managua and Masaya to concentrate
in Granada, keeping, however, the transit line
from San Juan del Sur to La Vírgen. The filibuster
chief now took advantage of the division of the allied
forces—Belloso and Jerez in Masaya, Zavala and Estrada
in Diriomo—and on the 11th of October made
a dash with 800 men on Masaya, which had a garrison
of 1,000. He entered the place at eight o'clock
and took positions in Monimbó, south of the town.
Early on the 12th he advanced as far as the blocks
contiguous to the plaza, which he would undoubtedly
have taken but for Zavala's attack on Granada.<a name='FA_XVII-27' id='FA_XVII-27' href='#FN_XVII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-27]</a> On
hearing of Walker's movement, Zavala started to the
relief of Masaya. At Diriá he was informed that
Walker was routed and in full retreat to Granada.
He then changed his course, and turned up at the
burying-ground of Granada with the view of getting
the start of the enemy; but as the latter did not
come, and he had positive information of the place
being weak, he resolved to occupy it at once, though a
heavy rain somewhat retarded the movement. He
might have taken the town by surprise either from
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_354' name='Page_354' href='#Page_354'>354</a></span>
the north to south, but went round by Jalteva.<a name='FA_XVII-28' id='FA_XVII-28' href='#FN_XVII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-28]</a> The
allied force had not till then been detected from the
city. But on the officer of the day descrying groups,
he went to ascertain if they were Walker's men, and
immediately giving the alarm, preparations were made
to meet the expected assault. Nevertheless, the allies
at two o'clock in the afternoon occupied the buildings
on the plaza, excepting the church, where the foreign
sick were intrenched. Zavala took Walker's house,
and finding there a flag, rushed out waving it, until a
bullet struck the flag, and another his surtout, when
he realized his danger. Both the Guatemalans and
legitimists gave themselves up to excesses.<a name='FA_XVII-29' id='FA_XVII-29' href='#FN_XVII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-29]</a> The
night of the 12th came on, and the church had not
been taken. Hearing the cannonading or receiving a
report, early that morning Walker hurried back, it
being preferable to save Granada than to take Masaya.
In the morning of the 13th, Zavala learned that the
enemy was rapidly approaching, and vainly tried to
check them at Jalteva. Zavala and Estrada fled in
the direction of Diriomo, leaving a considerable number
of drunken men in the streets, who were butchered.
Several Guatemalans fell prisoners.<a name='FA_XVII-30' id='FA_XVII-30' href='#FN_XVII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-30]</a> Zavala's
assault of the place where Walker had his base of

VERY FAIR FIGHTING.
</p>

<p>
A Costa Rican division under General José M.
Cañas started for Nicaragua, November 2d, and notwithstanding
the enemy's efforts to hinder it, occupied
San Juan del Sur and the road to La Vírgen, thus
cutting off Walker's communication with either point.
It concentrated at Rivas on the 13th, and was joined
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_355' name='Page_355' href='#Page_355'>355</a></span>
by Jerez with 300 Nicaraguans. It was now in communication
with the main combined army, which was
preparing to assail Granada. Belloso received information
from a friend in that city that Walker was on
the point of making another dash on Masaya with 600
men. The allied army, in the city and vicinity, was
now of about 3,600 men,<a name='FA_XVII-32' id='FA_XVII-32' href='#FN_XVII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-32]</a> and leaving out wounded,
sick, and servants, the effective force must have been
no less than 3,000. The filibusters came on the 15th
under Bruno Von Naztmer, a German, and were met
outside by Nicaraguans and 600 Guatemalans at three
o'clock in the afternoon. The enemy opened fire, and
the Guatemalans fled panic-stricken. However, the
first charge of the filibusters was checked, and they
now assumed the defensive. The Guatemalans returned
to the charge, and heavy fighting followed,
which lasted till night. The next morning Walker
took command, Naztmer being wounded, and pushed
his operations into the town, where the allies had concentrated
in the night, burning a number of buildings;
but he soon convinced himself of the impossibility of
accomplishing his purpose, and retreated to Granada
in the night of the 18th.<a name='FA_XVII-33' id='FA_XVII-33' href='#FN_XVII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-33]</a> At a council of war, it was
resolved to evacuate the city, after setting fire to the
buildings, leaving a garrison to keep the enemy in
check. This work of destruction was intrusted to
Henningsen, who at once ordered the citizens to leave
the place within a few hours before it was consigned
to the flames. And all the time the authors of this
vandalism were calling the Central American defenders
of life, home, and liberty savages and greasers,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_356' name='Page_356' href='#Page_356'>356</a></span>
and themselves lovers of freedom and disseminators of

</p>

<p>
In the early morning of the 24th the allied forces
marched out of Masaya by the Carretas road; at 2
o'clock in the afternoon they were defiling on the low
hills of the Otra banda, from which they could see the
bonfire, made by the self-styled regenerators of Latin
America, consuming seven churches and the public
buildings, together with the dwellings of the citizens
of Granada. The same day the allies had skirmishes
with the enemy, and were defeated.<a name='FA_XVII-35' id='FA_XVII-35' href='#FN_XVII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-35]</a> Martinez with
his men from the north next day operated against the
San Francisco building, and the filibusters in fear of
being cut off abandoned it, and concentrated in the
plaza. The night of the 25th was a very rainy one.
The 26th the filibusters, being hard pressed in the
plaza and Guadalupe street, kept up a constant
cannonade to keep open the way to the lake. On the
27th the filibusters had been driven from the plaza
and reduced to Guadalupe street between <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">La Sirena</span>,
a high house on the east of the parish church, and the
ruins of the church. The Guatemalans pressed them
from the south; the Nicaraguans from the north.<a name='FA_XVII-36' id='FA_XVII-36' href='#FN_XVII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-36]</a>
Henningsen's force was on the 1st of December only
150 men, out of 300 that he had retained to hold the
position of Granada with, and being invited by Zavala
to surrender, proudly refused.<a name='FA_XVII-37' id='FA_XVII-37' href='#FN_XVII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-37]</a>

WALKER WORSTED.
</p>

<p>
Walker had occupied San Jorge, distant three miles
from Rivas, where Cañas and Jerez were intrenched,
leaving his sick and wounded with a small guard on
the island of Ometepec,<a name='FA_XVII-38' id='FA_XVII-38' href='#FN_XVII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-38]</a> where he thought they
would be safe; but a party of Indians with their priest
Tijerino captured them on the 1st of December, and
destroyed everything on the island that could be of
use to the enemy. Walker did not lose sight of his
lieutenant Henningsen, to whom he finally sent relief
on the steamboat <i>Vírgen</i>, with which Henningsen
captured the small fort that had so harassed him,
and then, December 13th, left on the boat, taking with
him the 115 emaciated men that remained of his
original force. The site of Granada was now fully in
possession of the allies,<a name='FA_XVII-39' id='FA_XVII-39' href='#FN_XVII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-39]</a> who discovered in the woods
a number of wounded filibusters, and treated them
humanely, excepting one whom they put to death.
</p>

<p>
December 11th had been a day of joy in the allied
camp, owing to the arrival of General Florencio
Xatruch with the first contingent of Honduran
troops;<a name='FA_XVII-40' id='FA_XVII-40' href='#FN_XVII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-40]</a> but they were cut up in the attack of the
13th by Henningsen. This officer's success in extricating
himself with so much loss to his opponents
caused a panic among the allied leaders, and the
breaking out anew of dissension. Belloso and his
Salvadorans went back to Masaya, reporting the discomfiture
of the army. Whether out of spite, or
from ignorance of the state of affairs, the general
ordered Cañas to return to Costa Rica, and Jerez to
retreat to Masaya. The latter, as a subordinate, had
to obey; but Cañas, having come to fight the filibusters,
would not go back, and accompanied Jerez to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_358' name='Page_358' href='#Page_358'>358</a></span>
Masaya. Thus was Rivas evacuated by the allies,
and reoccupied by Walker without firing a shot.
</p>

<p>
The lake steamers were of great advantage to
Walker for the quick transportation of men and supplies,
and on the other hand, made it necessary that
the allied chiefs should have strong garrisons in
Granada and Masaya, preventing a movement on La
Vírgen and Rivas. The president of Costa Rica
determined to deprive Walker of those facilities. To
this end he despatched his brother, General José
Joaquin Mora, with troops to the confluence of the
San Cárlos and San Juan rivers, who reached it on
the 19th of December, and then going down in canoes
to San Juan del Norte, without encountering
much resistance, captured on the 24th four steamers.<a name='FA_XVII-41' id='FA_XVII-41' href='#FN_XVII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-41]</a>
They then went up the San Juan with the steamers,
two of which were left at the junction with the Sarapiquí,
and on the 28th took the Castillo Viejo with
the steamboat <i>Vírgen</i>, laden with artillery, rifles, and
ammunition. They next possessed themselves of Fort
San Cárlos, and soon after of the steamboat of the
same name, which had incautiously approached the
fort. All this being accomplished, Mora was placed
in communication with the allied forces of Granada,
and left Walker without means of transportation by
water, or to communicate with the northern sea-coast.
Had the allies acted with reasonable promptness, both
on land and water, Walker's end would have been a
matter of only a few days. But it was retarded by
their lack of union and generalship.<a name='FA_XVII-42' id='FA_XVII-42' href='#FN_XVII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-42]</a> His situation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_359' name='Page_359' href='#Page_359'>359</a></span>
was now critical. Desertions, which were frequent,
sickness, and scarcity of food, daily decreased his
force. For all that, he resisted in Rivas several
assaults from both the land and lake till the 23d of
February, and struck some heavy blows to the besiegers
in San Jorge.<a name='FA_XVII-43' id='FA_XVII-43' href='#FN_XVII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-43]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
THE INVADERS BESIEGED.
</p>

<p>
The allied leaders had, after a council of war on
the 23d of January, at Nandaime, appointed a general-in-chief,
and heads of the several departments. The
chief command was conferred on Florencio Xatruch.<a name='FA_XVII-44' id='FA_XVII-44' href='#FN_XVII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-44]</a>
His tenure lasted but a few days, José Joaquin Mora

orders of February 19th and 20th.<a name='FA_XVII-45' id='FA_XVII-45' href='#FN_XVII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-45]</a>
</p>

<p>
The allies came to the conclusion that it was advisable
to closely besiege the enemy rather than to
attempt further assaults. Xatruch occupied and held,
March 26th, the barrio de la Puebla, south of the city,
which was the only means of free ingress and egress
for the filibusters. Thus was Walker penned. But his
friends abroad had not forgotten him. Three Americans,
Lockridge, Anderson, and Wheat, brought 500
men to San Juan del Norte in March, and undertook
to ascend the river. Lockridge occupied La Trinidad,
but Titus was repulsed at the fort. They then concluded
to invade Costa Rica, as was then supposed,
for they essayed to go up the Sarapiquí; but soon
after entering the river their steamer blew up, and
the expedition came to naught.<a name='FA_XVII-46' id='FA_XVII-46' href='#FN_XVII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-46]</a>

<p>
The besieged, on hearing of the arrival, April 3d,
with reënforcements, of General Martinez, whose prowess
they had learned to respect, became alarmed, and
the next day eighty deserters entered the allied lines.
An assault in force was made April 11th, which failed.
Walker's casualties were quite small, while those of the
assailants were heavy.<a name='FA_XVII-47' id='FA_XVII-47' href='#FN_XVII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-47]</a> The latter secured possession
of San Juan del Sur, in order that Walker should receive
no further aid from that quarter. It was now
evident that the filibusters could not hold out much
longer. The original force of 1,000, though more or
less augmented with the arrival of every steamer, had
become reduced to about one half that number. The
garrison had an abundance of plantains, but no meat
other than that of asses, mules, and horses.

CAPITULATION OF WALKER.
</p>

<p>
An officer of the United States corvette <i>Saint
Mary's</i>, which had been some time lying at San
Juan, came on the 24th to Mora's headquarters to
solicit in the name of Commander Charles H. Davis
a truce of six hours, which was granted, for the removal
from Rivas of the women, children, and other
non-combatants. Walker, becoming apprised by that
officer of the failure of Lockridge's attempt to succor
him, signified a willingness to capitulate, not to the
general-in-chief of the besieging forces, as was natural,
but to commander Davis. To this Mora assented,
in order to bring the war to an end at once,
and save himself from certain complications he apprehended.<a name='FA_XVII-48' id='FA_XVII-48' href='#FN_XVII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-48]</a>
The capitulation being signed and carried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_361' name='Page_361' href='#Page_361'>361</a></span>
out, Walker and sixteen officers, after bidding adieu
to the army on the 1st of May, departed under the
escort of Zavala, for San Juan del Sur, where they
embarked on the <i>Saint Mary's</i>.<a name='FA_XVII-49' id='FA_XVII-49' href='#FN_XVII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-49]</a> Davis then delivered
the city of Rivas to Mora, and the rest of
Walker's men, about 400 in number, were transported
to the United States.<a name='FA_XVII-50' id='FA_XVII-50' href='#FN_XVII-50' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-50]</a>
</p>

<p>
The war being ended, the allied troops retired to
their respective states. But prior to their departure
there was an affair which might have ended in a sanguinary
conflict had it not been for the prudent course
pursued by most of the generals. The trouble arose
from the hot-headedness of Zavala, the commander
of the Guatemalans, who had been led to believe, by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_362' name='Page_362' href='#Page_362'>362</a></span>
an evil counsellor, that the government would not
return him some arms he had lent, nor furnish him
transportation, nor even pay him the honors due his
rank. All this was unfounded, but he maltreated the
officer of the guard at the government house, and
grossly insulted the president, his ministers, and
others, threatening to hang them on the church of
La Merced. His conduct was violent and scandalous.<a name='FA_XVII-51' id='FA_XVII-51' href='#FN_XVII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-51]</a>
Máximo Jerez and hundreds of soldiers rushed
to the government's defence, and there would have
been bloodshed but for Barrios of Salvador, who had
command of 1,800 men, and prevailed on Zavala to
go back to Chinandega, whence he marched to Guatemala,
where he was received with the honors he had
fairly won.
</p>

<p>
Mora returned to Costa Rica, leaving the command
in charge of Cañas. It is said that he had planned
to extend the boundaries of Costa Rica to the lake,
which he deemed an easy undertaking, as the Costa
Ricans had the lake steamers, and the Nicaraguans
would be sure to break out into civil war.<a name='FA_XVII-52' id='FA_XVII-52' href='#FN_XVII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-52]</a> War was

of her territory.<a name='FA_XVII-53' id='FA_XVII-53' href='#FN_XVII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-53]</a> But upon a second invasion

was not yet satisfied with the misery and desolation
he had wrought upon a foreign and unoffending people.
He must play the vampire further; he must conquer
Nicaragua and be a great man. Taking advantage of
the rupture between this republic and Costa Rica, he
prepared another expedition, with which, eluding the
vigilance of the United States authorities, he sailed
from New Orleans for San Juan del Norte. He was
arrested, however, at Punta de Castilla, December
8th, and sent back by Commodore Paulding, commanding

him high honors. Loyal men who took up arms in
the country's defence were also rewarded.<a name='FA_XVII-56' id='FA_XVII-56' href='#FN_XVII-56' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-56]</a> But like
a wild beast maddened by its wounds, Walker was
still bent on blood, if blood were necessary to subjugate
Central America to his will. He fitted out a
third expedition, and landing with its avant guard
at Trujillo on the 6th of August, 1860, seized the
funds of the custom-house, which were pledged to the
British government for the payment of Honduras' indebtedness
to its subjects.<a name='FA_XVII-57' id='FA_XVII-57' href='#FN_XVII-57' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-57]</a> The British war vessel
<i>Icarus</i> entered the port on the 20th, and her commanding
officer, Norwell Salmon, demanded that
Walker should forthwith leave the place, which he
did, fleeing to the eastern coast, where he and his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_364' name='Page_364' href='#Page_364'>364</a></span>
men underwent the utmost suffering in that uninhabited
marshy region. A party of Hondurans harassed
them, and Walker was wounded in the face
and leg. Finally, General Mariano Álvarez arrived
with a Honduran force at Trujillo, and together with
Salmon proceeded to the mouth of Rio Tinto, arriving
there on the 3d of September. Walker surrendered
to the <i>Icarus</i>, and was turned over to Álvarez,
who had him tried at Trujillo by court-martial. He
was sentenced to death, and executed on the 12th of
September. Thus ended on the scaffold the career of
William Walker, filibuster, pirate, or what you will.<a name='FA_XVII-58' id='FA_XVII-58' href='#FN_XVII-58' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-58]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The provisional government of Nicaragua on the
14th of January, 1857, organized a consultive council
of five members and three substitutes,<a name='FA_XVII-59' id='FA_XVII-59' href='#FN_XVII-59' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-59]</a> which was
installed on the 20th. To that body were referred
the strictures of ministers Cardenal and Castillo,
upheld by General Martinez, the two former having
resigned their portfolios because the president had
declined to transfer the seat of government to the
eastern department.<a name='FA_XVII-60' id='FA_XVII-60' href='#FN_XVII-60' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-60]</a> The council did not approve of
their course, and suggested that Martinez, under a
clause in the agreement of September 12, 1856, should
summon R. Cortés and P. J. Chamorro to fill the
vacancies in the cabinet. It does not appear, however,
that Martinez took any steps in that direction.
</p>

<p>
The old dissensions which Walker's war had kept
in abeyance now threatened to break out afresh.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_365' name='Page_365' href='#Page_365'>365</a></span>
Legitimists and democrats alike saw in bloodshed and
desolation the only means to settle their differences.
Martinez and Jerez, with some of their friends from
the east and west, and assisted by General Gerardo
Barrios, commissioner of Salvador, labored in vain to
effect an amicable arrangement.<a name='FA_XVII-61' id='FA_XVII-61' href='#FN_XVII-61' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-61]</a> Jerez concluded
that the only recourse now left to avert a war was for
himself and Martinez to assume the responsibility of
jointly governing the country dictatorially until it
could be again placed under a constitutional régime.
This plan being accepted, the two leaders organized
themselves, on the 24th of June, into a junta de
gobierno, otherwise called <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gobierno Binario</span>, which
was recognized by both parties, and the dreaded
calamity of war was avoided. The organization was
completed with the appointment of Gregorio Juarez
and Rosalío Cortés as the cabinet. Martinez and
Jerez continued at the head of affairs until the 19th
of October, when war with Costa Rica having been
accepted, they resolved to assume personal direction
of military operations, and resigned the executive
office into the hands of the ministers. Martinez was
then made general-in-chief of the forces, with ample
powers, and Jerez second in command.<a name='FA_XVII-62' id='FA_XVII-62' href='#FN_XVII-62' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-62]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
REORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT.
</p>

<p>
The first acts of the new government were to reconstitute
the supreme and other courts, and to summon
the people to choose a constituent assembly for framing
a constitution,<a name='FA_XVII-63' id='FA_XVII-63' href='#FN_XVII-63' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-63]</a> and a president of the republic.
At the suggestion of Cortés, and with the assent of
Jerez, Tomás Martinez was named to the people as a
proper person for the executive office, and he was
elected almost unanimously.<a name='FA_XVII-64' id='FA_XVII-64' href='#FN_XVII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-64]</a> He took the oath of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_366' name='Page_366' href='#Page_366'>366</a></span>
office on the 15th of November, promising to pursue a
policy of peace and conciliation,<a name='FA_XVII-65' id='FA_XVII-65' href='#FN_XVII-65' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-65]</a> and appointing
Juarez, Macario Álvarez, and Cortés, his ministers
respectively for foreign relations, treasury, and government.<a name='FA_XVII-66' id='FA_XVII-66' href='#FN_XVII-66' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-66]</a>
During his first term there were several
changes in the personnel of the cabinet.<a name='FA_XVII-67' id='FA_XVII-67' href='#FN_XVII-67' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-67]</a>
</p>

<p>
Martinez' administration not only gave Nicaragua
the longest period of internal peace she had ever had,
but promoted her prosperity in every branch, and
notably in finances. At the time of its inauguration,
the government had not one hundred dollars in the
treasury. The liberating army had not been paid during
the late war, and the only way to adjust the arrears
was by issuing warrants, which the merchants soon
got possession of at sixty to eighty per cent discount,
and returned to the treasury at par in payment of
import duties on merchandise, thus greatly reducing
the revenue from that source. The government also
adopted the unusual course of assuming to indemnify
private persons for the losses they had sustained during
the civil war, those resulting from the burning of
Granada included.<a name='FA_XVII-68' id='FA_XVII-68' href='#FN_XVII-68' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-68]</a> And yet Martinez, after his victory
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_367' name='Page_367' href='#Page_367'>367</a></span>
of April 29, 1863, against the united forces of Salvador
and Honduras, succeeded within six years in
doubling the amount of public revenues, and in arranging
for the payment of the foreign debt.

NEW CONSTITUTION.

<p>
The constituent assembly, on the 19th of August,
1858, adopted a new constitution, declaring Nicaragua
to be a sovereign, free, and independent republic under
a popular representative government.<a name='FA_XVII-69' id='FA_XVII-69' href='#FN_XVII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-69]</a> Two days later
the assembly resolved to continue acting as an ordinary
legislature, and decreed that all public functionaries
should retain their respective offices until the new
constitutional régime should have been installed. Prior
to this, on the 30th of January, that body had declared
illegitimate all the provisional administrations which
had ruled Nicaragua from 1854 till the 8th of November,
1857, excepting only the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">gobierno binario</span> from

PRESIDENT MARTINEZ.
</p>

<p>
During the first years of Martinez' rule, the most
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_368' name='Page_368' href='#Page_368'>368</a></span>
friendly relations seemed to exist between him and
the leaders of the two political parties. Jerez was
intrusted with important diplomatic duties.<a name='FA_XVII-71' id='FA_XVII-71' href='#FN_XVII-71' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-71]</a> At the
beginning of 1861, the president in his message to
congress stated that the country was at peace at home
and abroad, Salvador being the only nation that
had suspended diplomatic relations with Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XVII-72' id='FA_XVII-72' href='#FN_XVII-72' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-72]</a>
Again, in January 1863, the president congratulated
congress that peace reigned, and the country was prospering.
He said with pleasure that no Nicaraguan
was undergoing penalty for political causes.<a name='FA_XVII-73' id='FA_XVII-73' href='#FN_XVII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-73]</a> The
country was at the same time an asylum for the persecuted
and exiles of other states. However, this hospitality
extended to exiles gave rise to serious differences
with Salvador, whose demands were invariably disregarded,
until Barrios threatened to blockade the port
of Realejo.<a name='FA_XVII-74' id='FA_XVII-74' href='#FN_XVII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-74]</a> The consequence was, that Nicaragua
and Guatemala, pursuant to the treaty made September
20, 1862,<a name='FA_XVII-75' id='FA_XVII-75' href='#FN_XVII-75' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-75]</a> became allies in the bloody war that
broke out this year against Salvador and Honduras,

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_369' name='Page_369' href='#Page_369'>369</a></span>
there might be opposition to his holding the office a
second term. But congress, on the 5th of February,
1863, declined to accept it, and requested that he
should continue at the head of affairs at least for a
time. During the war with Salvador and Honduras,
Martinez commanded the army in the field, and Nicasio
del Castillo acted as president. At the end of the
campaign, Martinez and the troops were rewarded for
their services, he being raised to the rank of captain-general.<a name='FA_XVII-78' id='FA_XVII-78' href='#FN_XVII-78' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-78]</a>
He resumed the executive office August
31, 1863.<a name='FA_XVII-79' id='FA_XVII-79' href='#FN_XVII-79' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-79]</a> The most stringent orders were issued
against Jerez and others, declaring them traitors, and
decreeing that revolutionists were severally answerable
with their property for the expenses the government
had been put to by their acts. However, on the 20th
of April, 1864, an amnesty law was passed, though not
including the chief leaders.<a name='FA_XVII-80' id='FA_XVII-80' href='#FN_XVII-80' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-80]</a>
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of Martinez' second term some
attempts at revolution were made, and easily quelled.
They arose from a representation that Martinez contemplated
retaining power for life; but in a proclamation
of April 24, 1866, he pronounced the statements
false.<a name='FA_XVII-81' id='FA_XVII-81' href='#FN_XVII-81' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-81]</a> Following the example of Washington, he insisted
on his countrymen calling another citizen to the
executive chair, and Fernando Guzman having been
chosen,<a name='FA_XVII-82' id='FA_XVII-82' href='#FN_XVII-82' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-82]</a> he surrendered his authority to him on March
1, 1867. His rank as captain-general had been confirmed,
and upon his tendering a resignation, congress
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_370' name='Page_370' href='#Page_370'>370</a></span>
refused to accept it.<a name='FA_XVII-83' id='FA_XVII-83' href='#FN_XVII-83' class='fnanchor'>[XVII-83]</a> However, scarcely one year

<p>
In describing the early operations of the Costa
Ricans in Nicaragua against Walker in 1856, I alluded
to the sudden departure of President Mora and his
brother from Rivas for Costa Rica, because of tidings
received of an attempted insurrection against the government,
then temporarily in charge of Vice-president
Oreamuno. This revolt was soon quelled, and the
leaders and officers connected therewith were arrested
and expatriated. Oreamuno having died, Vicente
Aguilar was chosen vice-president on the 17th of
September, but resigned the position the next month.<a name='FA_XVIII-1' id='FA_XVIII-1' href='#FN_XVIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-1]</a>
A change of ministry took place on the 26th of September,
the distinguished statesman taking charge of
the portfolio of foreign relations.<a name='FA_XVIII-2' id='FA_XVIII-2' href='#FN_XVIII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-2]</a> The president,
owing to war against the filibusters, suspended the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_372' name='Page_372' href='#Page_372'>372</a></span>
action of the constitution on the 15th of November,
but repealed the decree a few days later.<a name='FA_XVIII-3' id='FA_XVIII-3' href='#FN_XVIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
The successful termination of the war was hailed in
Costa Rica with great joy, and the men who gave
this glorious page to her history were highly honored.
The president was made a captain-general,<a name='FA_XVIII-4' id='FA_XVIII-4' href='#FN_XVIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-4]</a> and the
officers, as well as the rank and file, were promoted
and otherwise rewarded.<a name='FA_XVIII-5' id='FA_XVIII-5' href='#FN_XVIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
The elections for president and vice-president of the
republic took place, and congress on the 4th of May,
1859, declared that Juan Rafael Mora had been reëlected,
and Rafael G. Escalante chosen for the second
position.<a name='FA_XVIII-6' id='FA_XVIII-6' href='#FN_XVIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
Mora's administration had initiated a number of
measures tending to the advancement of the country.
Among other improvements was that of the fine national
palace in San José. Costa Rica had enjoyed a
long period of internal peace with an increasing prosperity.
Mora was quite popular with the masses, but
encountered opposition from the property owners,
merchants, and army men. For this reason he could
not strengthen his government, and found himself at
the mercy of a coup de main the moment the people
thought their interests were jeopardized by his power.<a name='FA_XVIII-7' id='FA_XVIII-7' href='#FN_XVIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_373' name='Page_373' href='#Page_373'>373</a></span>
Hence the revolutionary movement that hurled him
from his executive office in the night of August 14,
1859. A provisional government, composed of his
political enemies, was at once organized, meeting with
no opposition on the part of the people. It was a
palace revolution, and no blood was spilt. Mora was
kept in confinement, though otherwise well treated
during three days at the end of which he was taken
to Puntarenas, and sent out of the country on an
American steamer. He settled with his family in
Salvador, where he introduced the cultivation of
coffee.

VICENTE AGUILAR.
</p>

<p>
The new government now took steps to have itself
confirmed by a constituent assembly, and to cause its
provisional president, José María Montealegre, regularly
elected. The influential man of the administration
was Vicente Aguilar, ex-vice-president, a wealthy
man, and the deadly enemy of Mora. He was the
minister of the treasury and of war, and by his instigation
some reactionary and despotic measures were
adopted, thereby increasing the general uneasiness.
The country was henceforth divided into two political
parties, each claiming to be the representative of law
and order.<a name='FA_XVIII-8' id='FA_XVIII-8' href='#FN_XVIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-8]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_374' name='Page_374' href='#Page_374'>374</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The constituent assembly, pursuant to convocation,
met on the 16th of October, and on the 26th of December
adopted a new constitution in 142 articles,
which was promulgated the next day. This fundamental
law was liberal except in the matter of religion,
as it neither recognized nor tolerated any form of faith
but the Roman catholic. All other rights of man
were conceded.<a name='FA_XVIII-9' id='FA_XVIII-9' href='#FN_XVIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-9]</a> The constituent congress adjourned
sine die on the 27th of December, and the ordinary
congress opened its session on the 22d of April, 1860,
on the next day declaring that José María Montealegre
had obtained a popular majority for the office
of president of the republic, and appointing the 29th
for his inauguration. On the 24th that body designated
the persons who were to fill the executive chair
in the temporary or absolute absence of the president.<a name='FA_XVIII-10' id='FA_XVIII-10' href='#FN_XVIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-10]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
DEATH OF MORA.
</p>

<p>
Before many months had passed, Costa Rica witnessed
a catastrophe which filled the whole of Central
America with sorrow, indignation, and shame. Mora,
the deposed president, had solemnly protested against
the revolutionary acts which deprived him of his office.
There were not wanting men, who, either honestly or
with evil intent, beguiled him into the belief that he
was wanted back, and would meet with a cordial reception
and support. He allowed himself to be thus
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_375' name='Page_375' href='#Page_375'>375</a></span>
deceived, and committed the error of going against an
accomplished fact, in an attempt to recover by force
the executive authority, which was now legitimately
held by Montealegre. He landed in September at
Puntarenas with a few friends, was received with apparent
enthusiasm, and got together about 300 or 400
men;<a name='FA_XVIII-11' id='FA_XVIII-11' href='#FN_XVIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-11]</a> but believing it safer to increase his force before
marching to the capital, he tarried behind, thus
allowing the government an opportunity to organize
superior forces, and to issue relentless decrees. The
government's forces assailed Mora on the 28th of
September at La Angostura,<a name='FA_XVIII-12' id='FA_XVIII-12' href='#FN_XVIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-12]</a> and defeated him. He
soon found himself forsaken by his men, and though
aware that stringent orders for his arrest had been
issued, he surrendered to his enemies on the 30th,
when he was tried by a drum-head court-martial, and
shot three hours after.<a name='FA_XVIII-13' id='FA_XVIII-13' href='#FN_XVIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-13]</a> This judicial murder of this
honorable, just, and progressive man, who had rendered
such great services in saving national independence,
caused general consternation and displeasure.
His invasion was not approved of, but no one had
imagined that his life could be in peril if he were
captured. Public opinion was pronounced against
such relentless vengeance. Even Nicaragua, which
had grievances against Mora, and had excluded his
supporters from her territory, regretted his untimely
end.<a name='FA_XVIII-14' id='FA_XVIII-14' href='#FN_XVIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-14]</a> In Costa Rica his death was attributed to bitter
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_376' name='Page_376' href='#Page_376'>376</a></span>
personal and sordid animosity. Public opinion
was not at fault. Mora wrote his wife, one hour before
his execution, on his faith as a Christian, that
Vicente Aguilar justly owed him upwards of $200,000;
and if he ever expected to die in peace with his God,
he should make restitution of that sum to Mora's
family. Aguilar, as minister of war, signed the orders
for the execution, and was responsible for Mora's
death. These orders included the execution of two
others, namely, General J. M. Cañas, and Manuel
Argüello, a young lawyer. The latter was saved by
General Máximo Blanco, but Cañas was shot two days
after Mora.<a name='FA_XVIII-15' id='FA_XVIII-15' href='#FN_XVIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
The penalty of death was doubtless intended by
Aguilar to be a settlement of accounts with the man
he detested; but it did not satisfy him; he added confiscation,
and to the end showed himself relentless in
his animosity to Mora's family and supporters. But
he did not long survive his victims, dying on the 26th
of April, 1861, of ossification of the heart. After his
death, a milder policy was inaugurated. A general
amnesty, from which were excluded only a few military
men who while in active service had joined revolts,
was issued;<a name='FA_XVIII-16' id='FA_XVIII-16' href='#FN_XVIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-16]</a> exiles returned to their country,
and regularity in affairs was restored. The government
gained in popular esteem by a scrupulous
observance of the promises made at the time of its creation,
restoring internal peace based on constitutional
liberty and a proper economy.<a name='FA_XVIII-17' id='FA_XVIII-17' href='#FN_XVIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-17]</a> However, Mora's
friends, though disposed to do justice to Montealegre's
administration, never would forgive its origin and early
acts. They and their political confrères brought on a
reaction against it. Party excitement became great,
and there was danger of civil war. Two presidential
candidates for the next term, namely, Aniceto Esquivel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_377' name='Page_377' href='#Page_377'>377</a></span>
and Julian Volio, were in the field, the former being a
warm friend of the administration, and the latter independent.
Montealegre was the first to suggest a compromise.
There was in Cartago a former minister of
Mora, Jesus Jimenez, who was finally agreed upon by
all parties for the executive office, and was accordingly
elected.<a name='FA_XVIII-18' id='FA_XVIII-18' href='#FN_XVIII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-18]</a> He took possession of the chair on the 7th
of May, Montealegre surrendering it with greater
alacrity than he had occupied it in 1859.<a name='FA_XVIII-19' id='FA_XVIII-19' href='#FN_XVIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-19]</a>
</p>
<p class="sidenote">JIMENEZ AND CASTRO.
</p>

<p>
Jimenez, during his administration, fully answered
expectations. He maintained peace by pursuing a
just and conciliatory policy. The country kept on
its career of progress and prosperity.<a name='FA_XVIII-20' id='FA_XVIII-20' href='#FN_XVIII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-20]</a> The next
president duly chosen was the founder of the republic,
José María Castro, for the term from May 8, 1866.<a name='FA_XVIII-21' id='FA_XVIII-21' href='#FN_XVIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-21]</a>
The number of ministers of state having been reduced
to two, the president decreed the organization of a
privy council whose members were to serve without
pay.<a name='FA_XVIII-22' id='FA_XVIII-22' href='#FN_XVIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-22]</a> Castro's government was a strictly economical
one. It diminished the number of officials, and suppressed
the president's guard of honor. The result
was that the treasury was enabled to meet obligations
contracted for the development of education, and of
the interests of the country.<a name='FA_XVIII-23' id='FA_XVIII-23' href='#FN_XVIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-23]</a>
</p>

<p>
During the presidential election in 1868, party agitation
jeopardized the public peace. The press became
virulent, not sparing even the families of prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_378' name='Page_378' href='#Page_378'>378</a></span>
men. The government was accused of making no
effort to check such abuses, or to restore harmony.
There would certainly have been a resort to arms but
for the moderation of the two chief officers of the
army, generals Lorenzo Salazar and Máximo Blanco.<a name='FA_XVIII-24' id='FA_XVIII-24' href='#FN_XVIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-24]</a>
These officers and others placed themselves at the
head of a pronunciamiento which took place at San
José on the 1st of November to depose Castro and suspend
the constitution of December 27, 1859. Jesus
Jimenez, the first designado, was then called to assume
the executive office, with ample powers to call a constituent
assembly. He accordingly placed himself at
the head of affairs, and convoked the assembly, to
meet on the 1st of January, summoning the people
also to choose the next president, together with senators
and representatives for the next constitutional
term to begin May 1, 1869.<a name='FA_XVIII-25' id='FA_XVIII-25' href='#FN_XVIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-25]</a>

and he was inducted into office with the usual formalities.<a name='FA_XVIII-27' id='FA_XVIII-27' href='#FN_XVIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-27]</a>
But owing to congress having refused to pass
a railroad bill, Jimenez lost his temper, resigned his
office, and left the capital. But the resignation was
not accepted, and he was induced to return. Subsequently,
on his representing that the country was
in danger from internal disturbances due to party
violence, that body decreed a suspension of the constitution.<a name='FA_XVIII-28' id='FA_XVIII-28' href='#FN_XVIII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-28]</a>
This order of things lasted until the 27th
of April, 1870, on which day sixteen men, among
whom were Tomás and Víctor Guardia, Pedro and
Pablo Quiroz, and Próspero Fernandez, captured the
artillery barracks of San José by a coup de main.
There were a few killed and wounded, among the
former being the commander, Colonel A. Biscoubi, a
French officer who distinguished himself in the defence
of San Salvador in 1863.<a name='FA_XVIII-29' id='FA_XVIII-29' href='#FN_XVIII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-29]</a>
</p>

<p>
After the capture of the barracks the president was
seized, and kept a prisoner about twenty-four hours.
Bruno Carranza was then proclaimed provisional president,
and assumed the duties on the 28th. Jimenez and
his ministers were detained to answer charges that
would be preferred against them.<a name='FA_XVIII-30' id='FA_XVIII-30' href='#FN_XVIII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-30]</a> Jimenez was allowed
to reside in Cartago under surveillance; but,
fearing for his life, as he alleged, escaped.<a name='FA_XVIII-31' id='FA_XVIII-31' href='#FN_XVIII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-31]</a> The men
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_380' name='Page_380' href='#Page_380'>380</a></span>
who brought about the overthrow of the oppressive
government of Jimenez were not left unrewarded.<a name='FA_XVIII-32' id='FA_XVIII-32' href='#FN_XVIII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-32]</a>
All proscriptive orders which had emanated from it
were revoked, and persons in exile were enabled to
come back.
</p>

<p>
The people were again summoned to elect a constituent
assembly to meet on the 8th of August,
which took place; it declared the constitution of
1869 no longer in force, and temporarily revived
that of December 1859. Carranza resigned on the
same day that the convention assembled, and Tomás
Guardia<a name='FA_XVIII-33' id='FA_XVIII-33' href='#FN_XVIII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-33]</a> was appointed his successor on the 10th.
One of Carranza's last acts, July 30th, was to suspend
the treaty of friendship with Guatemala of 1848,
because the latter had closed diplomatic relations
with Costa Rica.<a name='FA_XVIII-34' id='FA_XVIII-34' href='#FN_XVIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-34]</a> It is to be said to the credit of
Carranza's short rule that though clothed with dictatorial
powers they were used very sparingly.<a name='FA_XVIII-35' id='FA_XVIII-35' href='#FN_XVIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-35]</a>

<p>
Public tranquillity was constantly menaced, till
finally a number of assemblages passed resolutions to
rescind the powers conferred on the constituent assembly,
and granted the authority of a dictator to Tomás
Guardia, whereupon on the 10th of October that body
was dissolved by him.<a name='FA_XVIII-36' id='FA_XVIII-36' href='#FN_XVIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-36]</a> That same day he decreed a
full amnesty to Ex-president Jimenez and his ministers
Agapito Jimenez and Eusebio Figueroa. He
next, on the 13th, created a council of state with prominent

political men,<a name='FA_XVIII-37' id='FA_XVIII-37' href='#FN_XVIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-37]</a> assumed personal command of the
forces, and appointed Rafael Barroeta his substitute.
In May 1871, several prominent citizens were ordered
to reside on the Golfo Dulce.<a name='FA_XVIII-38' id='FA_XVIII-38' href='#FN_XVIII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-38]</a>

<p>
A constituent assembly was convoked on the 12th
of August,<a name='FA_XVIII-39' id='FA_XVIII-39' href='#FN_XVIII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-39]</a> and met on the 15th of October, which
adopted another fundamental law for the republic on
the 7th of December. It was a most liberal constitution,
recognizing all the rights of man. On religion
it accepted the Roman catholic as the only one to be
supported, but tolerated other forms. Foreigners
were allowed the privilege of trading and other lawful
industries, including navigation of rivers and coasts,
of holding property, marrying, and testating. They
could not be compelled to become citizens, but if they
wished it, one year's residence sufficed to obtain naturalization.
The government was declared to be popular,
representative, alternative, and responsible. It
was divided into three branches; namely, legislative,
executive, and judicial.<a name='FA_XVIII-40' id='FA_XVIII-40' href='#FN_XVIII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-40]</a>
</p>

<p>
The national congress being installed May 1, 1872,
on the 30th declared Tomás Guardia duly elected
president, and on the same date appointed José Antonio
Pinto and Rafael Barroeta first and second vice-president
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_382' name='Page_382' href='#Page_382'>382</a></span>
respectively. The same body June 20th
granted Guardia leave of absence, with permission to
visit foreign countries for the benefit of his health,
and authorized the government to appropriate out of
the treasury a sum not exceeding $25,000 for his
travelling expenses. José A. Pinto had charge of the
executive in his absence.<a name='FA_XVIII-41' id='FA_XVIII-41' href='#FN_XVIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-41]</a> Guardia reassumed his
office on the 26th of January, 1873.
</p>

<p>
The policy Guardia's government had pursued
toward Guatemala, Salvador, and Nicaragua caused
these three powers to prepare for any emergency
which might arise. They accordingly entered into
a treaty of alliance on the 26th of August, 1873.<a name='FA_XVIII-42' id='FA_XVIII-42' href='#FN_XVIII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-42]</a>
Minister Montúfar had been the only one to endeavor
to check Guardia's hare-brained plans; but he was despatched
to Europe with the intent of dismissing him
in his absence. Costa Rica, on the 24th of October,
addressed a circular to other governments remonstrating
against that treaty.<a name='FA_XVIII-43' id='FA_XVIII-43' href='#FN_XVIII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-43]</a> Her government implied
that the treaty had been prompted by private animosity,

<p>
This state of affairs created much alarm in Costa
Rica, as well as elsewhere in Central America, and
Guardia, professing to give way to the demands of
public opinion, which pointed to him as the sole promoter
of war, temporarily resigned the executive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_383' name='Page_383' href='#Page_383'>383</a></span>
office into the hands of the first designado, Salvador
Gonzalez, on the 21st of November.<a name='FA_XVIII-45' id='FA_XVIII-45' href='#FN_XVIII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-45]</a> Gonzalez
formed a new cabinet, with José M. Castro as minister

would secure public confidence at home and peace
with the other states.<a name='FA_XVIII-46' id='FA_XVIII-46' href='#FN_XVIII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-46]</a> Gonzalez and his ministers
had believed in Guardia's sincerity, but they soon discovered
that he had been playing a hypocritical rôle.
Pretending indignation at what he called lowering the
country's honor, and trailing its flag in the dust,<a name='FA_XVIII-47' id='FA_XVIII-47' href='#FN_XVIII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-47]</a> he
resumed the presidential office on the 1st of December,
and the next day placed it in charge of Rafael
Barroeta,<a name='FA_XVIII-48' id='FA_XVIII-48' href='#FN_XVIII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-48]</a> who held it till the 28th of February,
1874, when Guardia resumed it. The latter was again
granted a leave of absence May 19, 1875, and was
absent several months.<a name='FA_XVIII-49' id='FA_XVIII-49' href='#FN_XVIII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-49]</a>

<p>
Some further correspondence passed between the
governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, resulting
from an abortive attempt at revolution in Guanacaste,
when the insurgents, being defeated, escaped into
Nicaragua. A force of Costa Ricans landed from a
steamer, killed some persons and arrested others in
territory claimed to be within the neutral district,
under the boundary treaty of 1858, which both parties
had bound themselves to respect till the question of
limits should be finally settled.<a name='FA_XVIII-50' id='FA_XVIII-50' href='#FN_XVIII-50' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-50]</a> Congress, in March

Guanacaste, on the frontier of Nicaragua, and defend
the country's honor, if assailed. He was also to
arrange, if possible, the troubles with that republic.
Guardia visited the frontier, where General Máximo
Jerez and a number of officers also went via Puntarenas.<a name='FA_XVIII-51' id='FA_XVIII-51' href='#FN_XVIII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-51]</a>

On the 27th of March a general amnesty was issued

had been constitutionally chosen president of the republic,<a name='FA_XVIII-53' id='FA_XVIII-53' href='#FN_XVIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-53]</a>
and on the 9th appointed Tomás Guardia and
Vicente Herrera first and second designados in the
order named. On the 8th Guardia took the chief
command of the forces; and as the constitution did
not allow of his reëlection to the presidential chair, he
could reoccupy it at pleasure by virtue of his position

MORE REVOLUTIONS.

<p>
Esquivel inaugurated his administration under favorable
circumstances. He pledged himself to pursue a
conciliatory policy, at home and abroad, though never
failing to uphold the rights of Costa Ricans in foreign
lands. Discord, however, broke out, and the opponents
of Guardia vented their hostility by the press.
A revolt, with bloodshed, occurred in Cartago, July
29th, and 30th, to depose Esquivel,<a name='FA_XVIII-55' id='FA_XVIII-55' href='#FN_XVIII-55' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-55]</a> which movement

was called to occupy the executive seat.<a name='FA_XVIII-56' id='FA_XVIII-56' href='#FN_XVIII-56' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-56]</a> The

Herrera's administration was noted for its illiberality
toward foreigners, and for religious bigotry.<a name='FA_XVIII-58' id='FA_XVIII-58' href='#FN_XVIII-58' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-58]</a>
The press was gagged; capitalists and merchants
were heavily mulcted on the pretext of their being
malecontents; men of reputation and standing were
driven from their homes upon the reports of paid
spies; and other outrages were committed.
</p>

<p>
A revolutionary movement on the 11th of September,
1877, forced Herrera to surrender the executive
office<a name='FA_XVIII-59' id='FA_XVIII-59' href='#FN_XVIII-59' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-59]</a> to Tomás Guardia, who assumed the duties,

president with unlimited powers.<a name='FA_XVIII-60' id='FA_XVIII-60' href='#FN_XVIII-60' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-60]</a> On the 24th
he called on the people to choose a constituent assembly
to meet on the 23d of December. The same day
he created a <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">gran consejo nacional</span>, delegating the
choice of the majority of its members to the municipalities.
That body, under its constitution, had devolved
upon it several important duties.<a name='FA_XVIII-61' id='FA_XVIII-61' href='#FN_XVIII-61' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-61]</a> A general
amnesty law for political offences was decreed October

<p class="sidenote">
ARBITRARY RULE.
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica was not, it seemed, to be free from
actual or impending trouble. Guatemala refused to
recognize Guardia's government, and the latter closed
relations with her as long as Barrios should be her
ruler.<a name='FA_XVIII-63' id='FA_XVIII-63' href='#FN_XVIII-63' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-63]</a> Early in the following January rumors came
that the republic would soon be invaded by a party of
men who had in Nicaragua organized a government,
and purposed establishing it in Costa Rica by force of
arms, if necessary. The invasion took place through
Limon, under the leadership of Federico Mora, who
called himself provisional president. In consequence
of this the law of guaranties, and the elections for
the constituent assembly, were suspended, and a decree
issued for the punishment of the invaders when
taken.<a name='FA_XVIII-64' id='FA_XVIII-64' href='#FN_XVIII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-64]</a> The attempt to overthrow Guardia failed,
Mora being defeated at El Zapote and Matina, and
fleeing to Nicaragua. The campaign lasted only eight
days.<a name='FA_XVIII-65' id='FA_XVIII-65' href='#FN_XVIII-65' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-65]</a> Quiet having been restored for a time, an
amnesty was granted to political offenders.<a name='FA_XVIII-66' id='FA_XVIII-66' href='#FN_XVIII-66' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-66]</a>
</p>

<p>
Very little worth mentioning occurred in 1879, except
that in October Costa Rica suspended relations
with Salvador. Guardia on the 10th of July, 1880,
restored the law of guaranties, and <a name="repeated" id="repeated"></a>repeated those of
January 21 and February 1, 1878, appointing August
1st for the election of deputies, and the 29th of the
same month for the instalment of the constituent assembly.
This body met on the appointed day,<a name='FA_XVIII-67' id='FA_XVIII-67' href='#FN_XVIII-67' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-67]</a> but
had been in session only about three weeks, when from
the liberal views introduced and discussed, and likely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_388' name='Page_388' href='#Page_388'>388</a></span>
to be incorporated in the new constitution, it became
apparent that Guardia would not be the popular choice
for the next presidential term. The last day's proceedings
were an indication of the doom of despotism.<a name='FA_XVIII-68' id='FA_XVIII-68' href='#FN_XVIII-68' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-68]</a>
Guardia and his satellites, alarmed at their impending
downfall, resolved that their safety lay in dissolving
the assembly, suspending the law of guaranties,
and imposing on the people anew the dictatorship.
This was done at once on the pretext of suppressing
an imaginary revolution. The military being all powerful,
Guardia on the 28th of September revived the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">gran consejo nacional</span> to meet at San José on the 16th
of October. He continued his usual arbitrary practices
of imprisoning and exiling such persons as made
themselves obnoxious to him.<a name='FA_XVIII-69' id='FA_XVIII-69' href='#FN_XVIII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-69]</a> In 1881 he revisited
Europe, and in his absence Salvador Lara acted as
president. A constituent assembly was convoked,
which adopted a constitution containing very liberal
clauses, on the 7th of December. This constitution
Guardia suspended on his return to power, early in
1882, but restored with amendments by his decree of
April 26th. Guardia's health had not been much
benefited by his journey to Europe, and death overtook
him at Alajuela in the evening of July 6, 1882.
The highest honors were paid to his remains, such as
were never seen in Central America before or after
the independence. They were buried in San José.<a name='FA_XVIII-70' id='FA_XVIII-70' href='#FN_XVIII-70' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-70]</a>
</p>

<p>
Saturnino Lizano had charge of the executive office
until the 20th of July, when he surrendered it to the
designado General Próspero Fernandez, who being
subsequently elected president was inducted into office
on the 10th of August.<a name='FA_XVIII-71' id='FA_XVIII-71' href='#FN_XVIII-71' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-71]</a> The new administration

<p class="sidenote">
CHURCH AFFAIRS.
</p>

<p>
The relations of the government with the church
became strained in 1883. Early that year a decree
was issued forbidding the entry of members of the
society of Jesus into the republic, though a few
who had charge of a college at Cartago were allowed
to remain. The clergy began an agitation, and had
to be advised by the government, and the bishop as
well, to moderate their zeal.<a name='FA_XVIII-73' id='FA_XVIII-73' href='#FN_XVIII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-73]</a> But the trouble did
not end. The old struggle between the civil and
ecclesiastical powers was revived. Bishop Thiel, with
the aid of the jesuits, attempted to interfere with and
to place himself above the government, which, on its
part, under the authority conferred by congress, resolved
to uphold its supreme authority at all hazards.
Hence a decree of July 18, 1884, expelling the bishop
and the jesuits from the country.<a name='FA_XVIII-74' id='FA_XVIII-74' href='#FN_XVIII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-74]</a> Other important
measures affecting the clergy were also adopted at
this time.<a name='FA_XVIII-75' id='FA_XVIII-75' href='#FN_XVIII-75' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-75]</a> The bishop was recalled in the following
year.
</p>

<p>
The republic was at peace, when a measure of the
legislative assembly of Guatemala came to create
a great alarm. I refer to the decree of February
28, 1885, declaring the union of Central America in
the form of a single republic, to carry out which
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_390' name='Page_390' href='#Page_390'>390</a></span>
scheme President Barrios assumed military command
over Central America. The news of this was received
by President Fernandez from Barrios himself
in a telegram on the 7th of March.<a name='FA_XVIII-76' id='FA_XVIII-76' href='#FN_XVIII-76' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-76]</a> The national
congress was then summoned to meet on Sunday the
8th, and the president called on the people to prepare
for the defence of Costa Rican independence. The
call was responded to with much enthusiasm. Congress
clothed the executive with extraordinary powers.<a name='FA_XVIII-77' id='FA_XVIII-77' href='#FN_XVIII-77' class='fnanchor'>[XVIII-77]</a>
But fate had decreed that Fernandez should be
saved the vexation of spirit and anxiety which the
situation must have caused him. He died suddenly in
Aténas between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning of
March 12th. Fernandez was greatly esteemed both
as a private and public man. His funeral took place
from the presidential mansion on the next day, with
the honors due his position as the national chief

<p class="sidenote">PRESIDENT DUEÑAS.
</p>

<p>
Francisco Dueñas, called to preside over the destinies
of Salvador in 1865, by the grace of President
Carrera of Guatemala, was a member of the legal profession,
and had already figured in public affairs. He
was from early youth destined for the cloister, and in
due time took the vows as a Dominican. But being
of an ardent temperament, he came after a while to
think himself adapted for a political leader rather than
to serve God under a monk's habit.<a name='FA_XIX-1' id='FA_XIX-1' href='#FN_XIX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-1]</a> He accordingly
entered the political field, and soon attained prominence.
In 1845 he was a minister of state, and had
previously been a deputy to the federal congress,
wherein for lack of eloquence he made no display;
but in committees and private conversations with his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_393' name='Page_393' href='#Page_393'>393</a></span>
colleagues, he often managed to have his ideas accepted.
He was one of the deputies who voted
against the fatal decree leaving the states free to constitute
themselves. He was then a friend of Central
American nationality, and often defended it almost as
warmly as Barrundia. Pretending to follow public
opinion, he was affiliated with the liberals. But his
chief aim was even then the furtherance of his own
political advancement. Thus we see him join the oligarchic
clique, and ally himself with Carrera of Guatemala,
from which time he discountenanced every
attempt to restore true democracy. The republic
became one in name only, for his government was
personal and absolute.<a name='FA_XIX-2' id='FA_XIX-2' href='#FN_XIX-2' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-2]</a> With the aid of the oligarchs
he managed to sustain himself for years, the country
enjoying peace and material prosperity, for which, as
well as for his not neglecting public education, he
should have some credit.<a name='FA_XIX-3' id='FA_XIX-3' href='#FN_XIX-3' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
In December 1868, he was elected president for
the next term, and public affairs continued in a nominal
condition for some time, the most friendly relations
being maintained with foreign powers, and specially
with the other Central American states. But in the
latter part of 1870 serious differences occurred with
the government of Honduras, the latter imputing to
Salvador marked favors to Honduran and Nicaraguan
refugees, who were constantly plotting to overthrow
the administration of President Medina. At last the
Honduran government accredited two commissioners,
namely Céleo Arias, and Teodoro Aguiluz, in San Salvador,
with the view of settling those differences,
if possible, in a friendly manner. Salvador on her
part named Rafael Zaldívar her commissioner to treat
with them, and their conferences began on the 16th
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_394' name='Page_394' href='#Page_394'>394</a></span>
of January, 1871, but they led to no satisfactory result.<a name='FA_XIX-4' id='FA_XIX-4' href='#FN_XIX-4' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-4]</a>
At the fourth and last conference, on the 21st
of January, the Honduran commissioners, after protesting
against Salvador's course in rejecting their
demands, proposed as a last resort to preserve friendship—in
view of the fact that all hope of arriving at
an understanding had disappeared, as confidence between
the two governments no longer existed—that
the legislatures of both states should be convoked to
meet on the 12th of March, and the two presidents,
Medina and Dueñas, resign their offices. After which
elections for chief magistrates should be held, with
the express condition that during those elections both
Medina and Dueñas should reside out of their countries.
Four days having elapsed without any answer
having been returned to that proposition, the Honduran
commissioners on the 25th renewed their protest,
declared the conferences closed, and demanded their
passports. However, after this, Zaldívar signified to
them an acceptance of the proposal concerning the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_395' name='Page_395' href='#Page_395'>395</a></span>
resignation. This inspired some hope that peace might
yet be consolidated. But it proved to be a vain hope;
for the government of Honduras on the 7th of February
suspended all treaty stipulations between the
two republics, and Salvador despatched in the same
month a body of troops to invade her neighbor's territory;<a name='FA_XIX-5' id='FA_XIX-5' href='#FN_XIX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-5]</a>
in consequence of which President Medina on
the 5th of March declared war against Salvador, or
rather against Dueñas' government.<a name='FA_XIX-6' id='FA_XIX-6' href='#FN_XIX-6' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-6]</a>

HOSTILITIES WITH HONDURAS.
</p>

<p>
The liberal party took advantage of the situation to
adopt active measures for the overthrow of despotism,
and the restoration of democratic principles. General
Santiago Gonzalez, who had been called to head a
movement, made an address to the people, which produced
a great excitement. Dueñas tried to strengthen
himself by means of a so-called plebiscite, but this only
served to show that a revolution was impending.
Gonzalez applied for aid to the government of Honduras,<a name='FA_XIX-7' id='FA_XIX-7' href='#FN_XIX-7' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-7]</a>
which, being then on the point of waging war
against Dueñas, was prevailed on to place under command
of that officer the forces he had organized to
invade Salvador through Sensuntepeque. With his
Salvadorans and Honduran allies Gonzalez made himself
master of the departments of Santa Ana and
Sonsonate,<a name='FA_XIX-8' id='FA_XIX-8' href='#FN_XIX-8' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-8]</a> from which he could procure abundant
supplies. The government forces, which had been
kept in suspense, not knowing which would be the
invaders' objective point, attacked them at Santa
Ana, and after four days' hard fighting, though much
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_396' name='Page_396' href='#Page_396'>396</a></span>
superior in numbers, were utterly routed on the 10th
of April, with heavy casualties; the main army was
put to flight, and the reserve forsook their standard.<a name='FA_XIX-9' id='FA_XIX-9' href='#FN_XIX-9' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-9]</a>
Gonzalez was then proclaimed provisional president,
and Dueñas' government collapsed, he, together with
Tomás Martinez, ex-president of Nicaragua, who commanded
in chief the government's army, and others,
seeking a place of safety in the United States legation,
then in charge of General A. T. A. Torbert, minister
resident. The next day Gonzalez and his army
marched into the capital amid the most enthusiastic
acclamations. His first step was to protect the person
of Dueñas against possible violence from his exasperated
enemies, among whom were the friends of the
never-forgotten Gerardo Barrios, whom Dueñas had
caused to be shot in cold blood, and to obtain his surrender
that he might answer before the nation for his
alleged illegal acts.<a name='FA_XIX-10' id='FA_XIX-10' href='#FN_XIX-10' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-10]</a> Both Dueñas and Martinez were
surrendered to the provisional government on its giving
a pledge that their lives would not be imperilled.
The surrender of Dueñas was made on the 20th of
April, with his own acquiescence; he was then transferred
as a state prisoner to the military school building.<a name='FA_XIX-11' id='FA_XIX-11' href='#FN_XIX-11' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-11]</a>
Martinez was released and permitted to leave
the republic.<a name='FA_XIX-12' id='FA_XIX-12' href='#FN_XIX-12' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-12]</a>
</p>

<p>
Ex-president Dueñas was, on the 13th of April,
1872, declared by the senate legally deposed, and
amenable to the laws for acts of usurpation. Murders,
among which was reckoned the execution of Ex-president
Barrios, unjustifiable executions, and imprisonments
of citizens, incendiarism, misappropriation of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_397' name='Page_397' href='#Page_397'>397</a></span>
public moneys, and other misdemeanors. It was further
ordered that the accused should be turned over
to the jurisdiction of the courts for trial, pursuant to
article 71 of the constitution.<a name='FA_XIX-13' id='FA_XIX-13' href='#FN_XIX-13' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-13]</a> In July of the same
year, while the constitution was in suspense, during a
temporary internal disturbance, the supreme court set
him at liberty, which caused much agitation in Salvador.
He left the country after giving bonds in $100,000
that he would not land in any port of Central
America. He went to and remained in Europe
some time, then returned to America, residing a while
in New York, and afterward in San Francisco, California.
Subsequently he was permitted free access
to his country, and was treated with high consideration
both in Salvador and Guatemala.

<p class="sidenote">NEW CONSTITUTION.</p>

<p class="p2">
The constituent assembly, which had been convoked
by the provisional government, was installed July
28, 1871, and began its labors on the 31st, when the
provisional president gave an account of his official
acts, all of which were legalized at once.<a name='FA_XIX-14' id='FA_XIX-14' href='#FN_XIX-14' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-14]</a> The following
persons were, in the order named, designated
to take charge of the executive, provisionally, in the
event of disability of Gonzalez; namely, Rafael Campo,
Manuel Gallardo, and Cruz Ulloa.
</p>

<p>
On the 16th of October, the assembly adopted a
new fundamental law in twelve titles, which may be
said to have been in perfect accord with democratic
principles.<a name='FA_XIX-15' id='FA_XIX-15' href='#FN_XIX-15' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-15]</a> This constitution was amended on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_398' name='Page_398' href='#Page_398'>398</a></span>
9th of November, 1872, in a few particulars by a constituent
assembly, the presidential term being made
of four years instead of two. He could neither be
reëlected for the next immediate term, nor act as
president even a single day beyond the time for
which he was chosen.<a name='FA_XIX-16' id='FA_XIX-16' href='#FN_XIX-16' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-16]</a> This same assembly in 1872
enacted several secondary laws of importance, to wit:
on freedom of the press; trial by jury in criminal and
libel cases; use of martial law; elections by universal
suffrage; public instruction; codification of the laws
in force since 1821; and appropriation of private
property for great public uses.
</p>

<p>
The presidential election under the new charter of
1871 resulted in Gonzalez, the provisional president,
being chosen the constitutional chief magistrate, his
term to begin on the 1st of February the following
year. The amendment to the constitution of November
9, 1872, extended it to February 1, 1876.

<p class="sidenote">
CALAMITOUS TIMES.
</p>

<p>
The political relations of the governments of Salvador
and Guatemala with Honduras had, early in
1872, become so unfriendly that a war was unavoidable.
Salvadoran and Guatemala forces invaded Honduras,
and were successful in their operations, the
details of which will be given in connection with the
history of the latter country.<a name='FA_XIX-17' id='FA_XIX-17' href='#FN_XIX-17' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-17]</a> President Gonzalez
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_399' name='Page_399' href='#Page_399'>399</a></span>
and his victorious army on their return to San Salvador
in June received an ovation. Subsequent events
demanded the despatch of more troops to Honduras,
which, together with Guatemala's, completed the work
of the first campaign. The government also felt compelled
to exile a number of persons who were manifestly
conspiring for the destruction of the liberal
régime.<a name='FA_XIX-18' id='FA_XIX-18' href='#FN_XIX-18' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-18]</a> The ministers addressed an exposé to the
constituent congress, which had been in session since
September 27th, reviewing the policy of the administration,
and submitting for its sanction the late war
measures, at variance with the constitution. All the
acts of the president were subsequently approved by
congress.<a name='FA_XIX-19' id='FA_XIX-19' href='#FN_XIX-19' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-19]</a>
</p>

<p>
The only other event of 1872 worthy of mention
was the murder of the vice-president, Manuel Mendez,
on the night of the 1st of September, in the public
street,<a name='FA_XIX-20' id='FA_XIX-20' href='#FN_XIX-20' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-20]</a> by a man named Juan Melendez. At first it
was supposed that the act might have been prompted
by other motives than personal revenge; the latter
proved, however, to be the real cause. The assassin
fled into Honduras, but was finally discovered and
surrendered to Salvador, where he was tried and
executed.<a name='FA_XIX-21' id='FA_XIX-21' href='#FN_XIX-21' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-21]</a>
</p>

<p>
The year 1873 in its first part was a calamitous
one for Salvador. A series of earthquakes caused
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_400' name='Page_400' href='#Page_400'>400</a></span>
destruction in many places, specially on the 19th of
March, ruining the capital for the eighth time in its
history. The national congress, after approving the
government's acts to the date of closing its session,
left the country to devote its best energies in repairing
the havoc of that catastrophe. The rest of the year
and 1874 formed, indeed, a period not only of restoration
but of marked progress in every respect.
National industries went on developing, public instruction,
under the fostering care of the authorities,
was constantly being spread among the masses, and the
financial condition had become much improved. Peace
reigned at home, and the relations with foreign powers
were on an amicable footing; cordiality seemed to
preside over those with the other Central American
states. The future, at the inception of 1875, promised
concord and good-will as well as undisturbed progressiveness.<a name='FA_XIX-22' id='FA_XIX-22' href='#FN_XIX-22' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-22]</a>
But these expectations were not realized.
The public peace was disturbed on two occasions; the
first, by the Indians of Dolores Izalco, who, because
of a dispute with the authorities anent their community
lands, rose in arms, and on March 14th assaulted the
garrison of the city of Izalco, to be repulsed with considerable
loss. Their head men were arrested and
imprisoned some months, until, promising good behavior
in the future, they were released.<a name='FA_XIX-23' id='FA_XIX-23' href='#FN_XIX-23' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-23]</a> The other
affair was a more serious one, calling for energetic
action on the part of the military power. An armed
mob of reactionists and religious fanatics, led by one
Tinoco and a clergyman named José Manuel Palacios,
on the 20th of June, fell upon the city of San Miguel,
slaying the small garrison, together with the comandante
general, Felipe Espinosa, and several citizens,
sacking the business houses, and burning down a portion
of the town. Such deeds of blood, robbery, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_401' name='Page_401' href='#Page_401'>401</a></span>
incendiarism as those of the 20th to the 24th had
seldom been witnessed in Central America. Troops
arrived from La Union, and the Honduran port of
Amapala, on the 24th, and the malefactors fled, but
not before about thirty of their number, including
Father Palacios, were taken prisoners. A considerable
part of the stolen goods was recovered. Reënforcements
followed, and the department was secured from
further molestation. President Gonzalez was at San
Miguel on the 27th.<a name='FA_XIX-24' id='FA_XIX-24' href='#FN_XIX-24' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-24]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a sanguinary and disastrous war
with Guatemala caused an entire change in the administration.
</p>

<p>
The general assembly had, on the 1st of March, convoked
the people to elect on the first Sunday of December
a president and vice-president for the second
constitutional term to begin February 1, 1876, and
end February 1, 1880. Andrés Valle was chosen
president, and Santiago Gonzalez, vice-president. The
latter offered his resignation, but the assembly did not
accept it. They were inducted into office on the appointed
date. But previous to this, Guatemala having
assumed a menacing attitude, congress decreed that
in the event of the president going to the field at the
head of the army, Valle, then a senator, should act in
his stead, pro tempore. On the same date a forced
loan of $500,000 was also ordered to be raised.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PENDING HOSTILITIES.
</p>

<p>
The difficulties arose from a supposed understanding
of President Gonzalez with Guatemalan refugees in
Salvador, and the government of Ponciano Leiva in
Honduras, with the ulterior object of bringing about
the downfall of Barrios. The latter alleged also that
Gonzalez intended to uphold with his forces the government
of Leiva, which, according to him, was entirely
unpopular, because of its subserviency to Salvador.
This intervention was deemed not only an attack
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_402' name='Page_402' href='#Page_402'>402</a></span>
against Honduran autonomy, but a menace to Guatemala.
Gonzalez was notified that if he persisted in
that course, Guatemala would then interfere in favor
of General Medina, who was then trying to overthrow
Leiva. The result of this attitude was a renewed
assurance by Gonzalez of friendly feeling, and a proposition
to hold a verbal conference on Honduran affairs,
which Barrios accepted, and such a conference was
held now with President Valle at Chingo, and a convention
was signed on the 15th of February, under
which Marco Aurelio Soto, an Honduran by birth,
was to undertake the pacification of his country, backed
by equal forces of Guatemala and Honduras.<a name='FA_XIX-25' id='FA_XIX-25' href='#FN_XIX-25' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-25]</a> Barrios
contended that, though Valle was president, Gonzalez
was the real power in Salvador, whom he accused in
a public manifesto of hypocrisy and treachery. Angry
words continued, the two nations being now armed
for the conflict, till they agreed to disband their forces.
Both governments claimed to have done so, imputing
to the other a wilful neglect of its obligation.
The probability is, that, distrusting one another, they
merely pretended compliance, keeping their troops
ready for action. Barrios sent 1,500 men into Honduras,
and came himself with a force to threaten Salvador
on the west, and actually invaded the latter
without a previous declaration of war. At last, on
the 20th of March, José María Samayoa, minister of
war in charge of the executive of Guatemala, formally
declared all official relations with Salvador at an end,
and then again on the 27th, alleging that Salvadoran
troops had invaded Guatemala, decreed the existence
of war, giving Barrios unlimited power to make such
uses of this declaration as befitted the dignity of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XIX-26' id='FA_XIX-26' href='#FN_XIX-26' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-26]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_403' name='Page_403' href='#Page_403'>403</a></span>
The government of Salvador on the 26th
of March decreed the treaty of amity and alliance

longer in force.<a name='FA_XIX-27' id='FA_XIX-27' href='#FN_XIX-27' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-27]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
THE WRATH OF BARRIOS.
</p>

<p>
Barrios' plan for the campaign was to assail Salvador
on the west direct from Guatemala with an army
under his personal command, and at the same time
by a movement from Honduras under General Gregorio
Solares on the eastern departments of San Miguel
and La Union.
</p>

<p>
The Mexican general, Lopez Uraga, adjutant-general
of Barrios, was stationed with a garrison at
Jutiapa to guard the army supplies. At this time
the Salvadorans unsuccessfully attacked an isolated
position on the frontier, which roused the ire of Barrios.
He then directed Uraga to move the supplies
to Chingo, whence he started himself to the invasion
of Salvador. Solares had not yet been heard from.
He had first of all to get Medina and Leiva out of
the way in Honduras. The Guatemalan president
then marched to the Coco hacienda, and hearing that
Chalchuapa was abandoned, occupied it at once.
The Salvadorans had their headquarters at Santa
Ana. The armies which were to encounter each
other on the field of battle were the most numerous
Central America had ever seen. Barrios with 8,000
or 9,000 men laid siege of Ahuachapan. Uraga stationed
himself at Chalchuapa with about 1,500, and
Chingo was left with a handful of men.<a name='FA_XIX-28' id='FA_XIX-28' href='#FN_XIX-28' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-28]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Guatemalans who have occupied Apaneca were
driven away, and on returning thereto encountered
the Salvadorans on the 15th of April, and after a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_404' name='Page_404' href='#Page_404'>404</a></span>
fight lasting from eight in the morning till nightfall,
were routed, and pursued as far as Atiquizaya, sustaining
heavy losses.<a name='FA_XIX-29' id='FA_XIX-29' href='#FN_XIX-29' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-29]</a>
</p>

<p>
Meantime the belligerent armies in the east were
not idle. Solares after hard fighting from the 17th
to the 19th of April won a signal and decisive victory
at Pasaquina over the Salvadorans commanded
by generals Brioso, Delgado, Sanchez, and Espinosa;
the results of which were that he obtained control of
the departments of San Miguel and La Union, menacing
those of San Vicente and Usulutan, and even
the official residence of President Valle; thus depriving
the government of large resources, and disheartening
the army of Gonzalez in Ahuachapan and Santa
Ana.<a name='FA_XIX-30' id='FA_XIX-30' href='#FN_XIX-30' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-30]</a> After this victory, Solares being reënforced,
the Salvadorans, now reduced to 800 or 900, precipitately
retreated to San Miguel, but by desertions on
the march dwindled down to less than 200. The defence
of San Miguel became impossible, and Solares
occupied it, as well as La Union. There being insufficient
elements to defend San Vicente, the government
ordered the scattered garrisons to concentrate
at the capital.

CONVENTION AND TREATY.

<p>
The condition of the army of the west was not
much better. There were in Ahuachapan about 2,600
men, and in Santa Ana hardly 3,500. The former was
greatly decreased by constant fighting during the holy
week, and on the day after easter hardly exceeded 900
demoralized troops. An unsuccessful attempt was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_405' name='Page_405' href='#Page_405'>405</a></span>

of Ahuachapan.<a name='FA_XIX-31' id='FA_XIX-31' href='#FN_XIX-31' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-31]</a> He then marched to Atiquizaya,

Pursuant to the 6th clause of the convention of
April 25th, the people were called upon to choose, on
the first Sunday of June, a president and vice-president,
as well as representatives to the legislative assembly,

<p class="sidenote">CONSTITUTIONAL CONGRESS.</p>

<p class="p2">
The new administration had no home or foreign
complications to distract its attention from the usual
routine of duties, and progress was soon noticeable in
every branch of industry as well as of the public service.
The executive, on the 3d of April, 1879, called
the people to choose a constituent congress to effect
reforms in the constitution of November 9, 1872.
This body was duly installed June 9th, under the
presidency of Teodoro Moreno; but after appointing
a committee to frame a constitution, it adjourned July
2d to meet again between the 1st and 15th of January,
1880. It reassembled on the latter date, and
proceeded to consider the project of a fundamental
law laid before it by that committee. Some amendments
were finally adopted on the 19th of February,
and Zaldívar was reëlected president for the ensuing
term from February 1, 1880, to February 1, 1884.
</p>

<p>
Nothing worthy of special mention occurred till the
end of 1882. The constitutional congress opened its
session on the 5th of January, 1883, when the president
gave an encouraging account of the political situation.
Peace reigned, and the people were devoted
to their industrial pursuits. The relations with the
other nations of the earth were cordial, Salvador,
though a small power, being the recipient of respect
and regard from all others. With Costa Rica the relations,
interrupted since October 1879, were renewed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_408' name='Page_408' href='#Page_408'>408</a></span>
and with Nicaragua the most perfect understanding
existed. The treaty of alliance with Guatemala and
Honduras was in full force.<a name='FA_XIX-40' id='FA_XIX-40' href='#FN_XIX-40' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-40]</a>
</p>

<p>
But this happy state of things was not to last.
At 2 o'clock in the morning of April 16th, a body of
men armed with rifles, shot-guns, revolvers, and
machetes attacked the garrison at Santa Tecla, crying
Viva la religion! Viva el Doctor Gallardo! Mueran
Zaldívar y Barrios! They were repulsed by the
troops commanded by Colonel Matías Castro Delgado,
who captured forty prisoners. The government forces
went in pursuit of the others in the region of the
neighboring volcano.<a name='FA_XIX-41' id='FA_XIX-41' href='#FN_XIX-41' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-41]</a> The insurrectionary movement
had ramifications in other towns, namely, La
Libertad, San Salvador, Santa Ana, Ahuachapan, and
Sonsonate, where its authors expected to be seconded.
The president at once placed the departments of
San Salvador, La Libertad, and the west under
martial law. This and other prompt measures prevented
any further action on the part of the would-be
revolutionists. Quiet having been fully restored, the
decree of martial law was repealed.<a name='FA_XIX-42' id='FA_XIX-42' href='#FN_XIX-42' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another change in the constitution was made this
year. The executive called a convention on the 18th
of October to meet between the 15th and 20th of
December, to revise the charter of February 19, 1880,
adapting the fundamental institutions of the country
to its present needs; and also to take cognizance of
other matters which the executive would lay before it.<a name='FA_XIX-43' id='FA_XIX-43' href='#FN_XIX-43' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-43]</a>

who was to hold it till his return.<a name='FA_XIX-46' id='FA_XIX-46' href='#FN_XIX-46' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-46]</a> He was again
in San Salvador in August, and resumed his duties.

<p>
Another period of trouble is now again impending
on Salvador. Elsewhere I give the particulars of
the undertaking of Barrios, president of Guatemala,
to reconstruct Central America as one republic by
force of arms. It is unnecessary to do more than
glance at the same here. On finding a deliberate
opposition to his project on the part of the governments
of Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica, he
placed his army in the field to support any movements
in those republics toward the end he had in
view. The people of Salvador responded to the call
of their authorities,<a name='FA_XIX-47' id='FA_XIX-47' href='#FN_XIX-47' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-47]</a> who in a short time had about
1,800 volunteers enrolled, and relied, moreover, on
the aid of the other three governments equally interested
in defending their autonomy. About 12,000 men
were stationed on the western frontier under the direct
command of President Zaldívar, but no act of hostility
was committed, out of respect for the American minister,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_410' name='Page_410' href='#Page_410'>410</a></span>
who had been mediating, and obtained from Barrios
that he would not invade Salvador if his own
territory were not assailed. But this pledge went for
nothing. The Guatemalans invaded Salvador March
30th, compelling the Salvadorans who had been fortifying
the hacienda del Coco to abandon that position,
though only after severe fighting, and retire into their
fortifications of Chalchuapa.<a name='FA_XIX-48' id='FA_XIX-48' href='#FN_XIX-48' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-48]</a> The latter were assailed
by the whole force of the enemy, but the garrison returned
the fire with success, and gallantly met the
desperate onslaught until a signal victory crowned
their well-directed efforts. Barrios, the intrepid
leader of the Guatemalans, lost his life, but this did
not put an end to the fight for several hours yet.<a name='FA_XIX-49' id='FA_XIX-49' href='#FN_XIX-49' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-49]</a>
The discomfited assailants began their retreat to the
frontier at six o'clock, or a little later, in the evening,
unpursued.<a name='FA_XIX-50' id='FA_XIX-50' href='#FN_XIX-50' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-50]</a>

FRANCISCO MENENDEZ.
</p>

<p>
With the friendly intervention of the foreign diplomatic
corps an armistice was signed, giving time for
negotiations, which culminated in a treaty of peace
with Guatemala, the particulars of which are given elsewhere.<a name='FA_XIX-51' id='FA_XIX-51' href='#FN_XIX-51' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-51]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_411' name='Page_411' href='#Page_411'>411</a></span>
With Honduras<a name='FA_XIX-52' id='FA_XIX-52' href='#FN_XIX-52' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-52]</a> a treaty was concluded,
with the assent of the three allies, which restored
friendly relations. Zaldívar called congress to hold
an extra session, and laid before it, May 4th, an account
of the campaign and its results, and concluded,
asking that body to accept his resignation. This was
unanimously refused; nor was his subsequent request
for a year's leave of absence granted. But on his
declaring his intention of taking the unused time of
the leave given him in 1884, that body acceded, and
allowed him to be absent twelve months. On the
14th, he placed the executive authority in the hands
of the second designado, General Fernando Figueroa,
his minister of the treasury, who had the support of
Zaldívar's friends; and on the following day departed
for Europe.<a name='FA_XIX-53' id='FA_XIX-53' href='#FN_XIX-53' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-53]</a> An insurrection had already broken
out in the west, promoted by political adversaries,
whose leader was General Francisco Menendez. The
government reported a victory over the insurgents at
Armenia the 19th of May, but the revolution gained
ground so rapidly that Menendez, who had been proclaimed
presidente provisorio, made his triumphal
entry in San Salvador on the 22d, midst the acclamations
of the populace.<a name='FA_XIX-54' id='FA_XIX-54' href='#FN_XIX-54' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-54]</a> The revolution was successful,
and the new government was afterward recognized
by foreign powers.<a name='FA_XIX-55' id='FA_XIX-55' href='#FN_XIX-55' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-55]</a>
</p>

<p>
In August, Menendez called on the people to choose
a constituent convention, and preparations were made
therefor; but disturbances having occurred in several
places, he prolonged his dictatorship and redeclared
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_412' name='Page_412' href='#Page_412'>412</a></span>
martial law.<a name='FA_XIX-56' id='FA_XIX-56' href='#FN_XIX-56' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-56]</a> Zaldívar was charged with improper
uses of the public funds, and the government refused
to recognize a certain indebtedness incurred in his administration.
His property in Salvador was seized,
and an attempt was made by certain persons to lay
hands on some real estate of his in Costa Rica, but
they were not permitted to do so.<a name='FA_XIX-57' id='FA_XIX-57' href='#FN_XIX-57' class='fnanchor'>[XIX-57]</a> Shortly after
there was a rupture with Nicaragua, which did not
last long, a treaty of peace being signed at Amapala

<p>
Upon the demise of President Carrera, April 14,
1865, the government devolved for a time on Pedro
de Aycinena, minister of foreign affairs, who summoned
the legislative body to choose a successor in
the executive seat. The person then selected was
Vicente Cerna,<a name='FA_XX-1' id='FA_XX-1' href='#FN_XX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XX-1]</a> who took possession of the chair with
the usual formalities on the 24th of May, and in his
manifesto and inaugural made known that his policy
would be that of the preceding administration, being
assured of the coöperation of the late president's ministers,
whose qualifications he could not too highly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_414' name='Page_414' href='#Page_414'>414</a></span>
extol.<a name='FA_XX-2' id='FA_XX-2' href='#FN_XX-2' class='fnanchor'>[XX-2]</a> Though a brave man, and not an unskilful
general, Cerna was not gifted with the extraordinary
acuteness of Carrera; and not possessing the support
and overawing power which the late ruler had over
the liberals, omens of trouble began to appear in the
political horizon. The fact is, that the assembly and
people, at the time of his election, had expected some
reforms of the former policy. But at the end of
nearly two years these expectations had vanished, and
insurrections were erelong set on foot; for the liberal
party, though kept under so many years, had not died
out. Justo Rufino Barrios, hitherto a refugee in
Chiapas,<a name='FA_XX-3' id='FA_XX-3' href='#FN_XX-3' class='fnanchor'>[XX-3]</a> now appeared on the theatre of war, rendering
efficient aid to the most influential opponent of the
government, Serapio Cruz, one of Carrera's generals,
who had early in February 1867 initiated a revolution
in Sanarate, recruiting men and capturing arms
from Guastatoya.<a name='FA_XX-4' id='FA_XX-4' href='#FN_XX-4' class='fnanchor'>[XX-4]</a> Though corpulent, Cruz was energetic
and strong, active in his movements, and possessing
a knowledge of the mountainous region, could
not be easily subdued by the government.<a name='FA_XX-5' id='FA_XX-5' href='#FN_XX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XX-5]</a> However,
it so happened that Brigadier Solares pressed him
hard, and he had to flee, when his followers abandoning
him, he asked for a safe-conduct out of the country,
which was given him on the 8th of April, and he
was taken under a guard to the frontier of Salvador.<a name='FA_XX-6' id='FA_XX-6' href='#FN_XX-6' class='fnanchor'>[XX-6]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_415' name='Page_415' href='#Page_415'>415</a></span>
The government did not sanction this proceeding of
Solares.

<p class="sidenote">
BARRIOS' PRONUNCIAMIENTO.
</p>

<p>
A pronunciamiento took place at the Malacate hacienda,
belonging to Barrios, August 3d, the same year,
which also failed, the insurgents being defeated, and
their leader, Francisco Cruz, and thirty-seven others
captured by Indians friendly to the government, and
sentenced.<a name='FA_XX-7' id='FA_XX-7' href='#FN_XX-7' class='fnanchor'>[XX-7]</a> Serapio Cruz with twenty men invaded
Guatemala from Chiapas in March 1869. The government
decreed stringent measures.<a name='FA_XX-8' id='FA_XX-8' href='#FN_XX-8' class='fnanchor'>[XX-8]</a> Cruz on the
27th of April destroyed a small party of troops
under Lieutenant Abelar in the mountains. He was
on the 2d and 3d of May at Huehuetenango,<a name='FA_XX-9' id='FA_XX-9' href='#FN_XX-9' class='fnanchor'>[XX-9]</a> and on
the 4th marched to Momostenango with five hundred
Indians and some ladinos. About one hundred of
his men had fire-arms, a number only machetes, and
the rest were unarmed. He continued his march to
Santa María Chiquimula, thence to Santa Lucía, five
leagues distant, but abandoned it on the 6th, upon the
approach of government troops, going to Sacapulas,
as if to return to the mountains of Nebaj. Colonel
Battle reported May 20th from Nebaj the utter discomfiture
of Cruz that morning. His men had taken
flight, scattering in the mountains.<a name='FA_XX-10' id='FA_XX-10' href='#FN_XX-10' class='fnanchor'>[XX-10]</a> Another report
of the 23d stated that Cruz with only 23 men was on
the 21st fleeing through the unsettled region of
Chimal, as if bound to Chiapas by way of Chaculá. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_416' name='Page_416' href='#Page_416'>416</a></span>
seems that being pursued from all directions, he fled
from Verapaz, where he found no followers, to Canillá,
and succeeded in entering the Sierra Madre. In
Guatemala it was reported, July 30, 1869, that Cruz
had again taken refuge in Chiapas.<a name='FA_XX-11' id='FA_XX-11' href='#FN_XX-11' class='fnanchor'>[XX-11]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
While the government had been thus harassed by
insurgents in arms, the liberal opposition in the legislative
chamber was daily growing in strength. Deputy
Miguel García Granados repeatedly denounced the
arbitrary acts of the ministers. After a while there
came to be but few less liberals than conservatives in
the legislature, and when Cerna's term was approaching
its end, the opposition felt strong enough to have
a candidate of their own at the presidential election.
Cerna was brought forward by his party for the next
term—May 24, 1869, to December 31, 1872. The
liberals nominated General Victor Zavala, who had
won so much distinction in the Walker campaign, and
was popular with the military element.<a name='FA_XX-12' id='FA_XX-12' href='#FN_XX-12' class='fnanchor'>[XX-12]</a> Zavala was
defeated, though he had a respectable support in the
assembly,<a name='FA_XX-13' id='FA_XX-13' href='#FN_XX-13' class='fnanchor'>[XX-13]</a> which was an omen of a not distant change
in the political situation.
</p>

<p>
On the 24th of May, 1869, the date of Cerna's
second inauguration, there was a great popular excitement
at the capital. A revolution was impending.
At the approach of night every precaution was adopted
by the ministers to guard the president's mansion and
the public buildings. The troops were kept in the
barracks under arms. As darkness increased, cries of
Viva Zavala! were repeatedly heard, shots were fired,
several persons being wounded, and one killed in the
plaza del teatro. Zavala's friends tried to prevail on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_417' name='Page_417' href='#Page_417'>417</a></span>
him to lead them in an attempt to overthrow the administration.
He refused to do so, from motives of
prudence and unwillingness to cause bloodshed. He
strongly doubted that such a movement could be successful,
and was probably right, but his course on that
occasion lost him the regard of the more enthusiastic
portion of his political supporters. There had been
an escape from a sanguinary revolt, but the public
mind remained greatly agitated.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DETERMINED REVOLUTIONISTS.
</p>

<p>
Cerna in his inaugural address had said that the
troubled state of the country had demanded his acceptance
of a reëlection, and that this opportunity,
when the republic was at peace with the other Central
American states, and with all foreign powers, was a
favorable one for good citizens to aid the government
in securing quiet at home. But his advice was unheeded.
Neither he nor his ministers were allowed
any peace. García Granados continued his agitation
in the legislative chamber, his denunciations of the
government growing from day to day louder and more
menacing. The president and his cabinet were aware
that a large portion of the middle class in the chief
towns sided with the liberal agitator, and that the
leaven of liberalism already was working in the army.
Several superior officers were accordingly distrusted,
and the lower ones serving under them were of course
looked on as unreliable. The treasury was empty,
and the country burdened with a heavy debt, both internal
and foreign.<a name='FA_XX-14' id='FA_XX-14' href='#FN_XX-14' class='fnanchor'>[XX-14]</a> Meantime, Serapio Cruz was
daily gaining strength on the north-western frontier.
He was supplied with money by the liberals, with
which he bought arms for his followers. His Indian
allies kept him advised of every advance of government
troops.<a name='FA_XX-15' id='FA_XX-15' href='#FN_XX-15' class='fnanchor'>[XX-15]</a> He was exceedingly active and successful
in the latter part of 1869, having at this time
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_418' name='Page_418' href='#Page_418'>418</a></span>
from 700 to 1,000 men, and being efficiently seconded
by J. Rufino Barrios. Various collisions with the
government troops were favorable to the insurgents.
The latter assaulted Huehuetenango, a strongly garrisoned
place, and were repulsed, but not before they
had burned down a large part of it. In December
1869, Cruz approached the capital, and by rapid movements
evaded the superior forces of the government.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday, the 15th of January, 1870, the liberals
in the capital had made preparations for an outbreak
the following day, when Cruz was expected to march in
and support them. Early on Sunday there was much
excitement in the city. Unfortunately for their cause,
Cruz had relaxed his vigilance. Before noon it was
whispered that on the road leading from the eastern
gate to Palencia, a severe encounter had taken place;
next came a report that Cruz had been defeated and
killed, soon followed by another that his head was on
its way to the city. This proved to be a fact.<a name='FA_XX-16' id='FA_XX-16' href='#FN_XX-16' class='fnanchor'>[XX-16]</a> The
victors marched into the capital with their ghastly
trophy, the head of the man who had expected at that
moment to be master of the place.<a name='FA_XX-17' id='FA_XX-17' href='#FN_XX-17' class='fnanchor'>[XX-17]</a>

</p>

<p class="sidenote">
EXCEPTIONAL CLEMENCY.
</p>

<p>
All hope of success for the liberals was now at an
end, at least for a time. The correspondence of their
chief men with Cruz having been captured, the government
ordered their arrest, but most of them escaped.
José María Samayoa, the wealthiest of them,
was imprisoned a short time, and then banished, and
went to sojourn in San Salvador. García Granados,
after being some time concealed, was ultimately discovered,
and sought asylum at the British legation,
from which, by the intercession of other foreign representatives,
he was permitted to leave the country.
He went to reside in Chiapas.<a name='FA_XX-18' id='FA_XX-18' href='#FN_XX-18' class='fnanchor'>[XX-18]</a> The administration
must be commended for its magnanimity. Not a
single execution or confiscation of property followed
its triumph. Whatever the motive was which prompted
clemency to such bitter opponents<a name='FA_XX-19' id='FA_XX-19' href='#FN_XX-19' class='fnanchor'>[XX-19]</a> against the opinion
of many firm supporters, it may not be denied that
it eventually brought about the government's overthrow;
for the condition of the liberals, though overspread
with gloom, was not altogether hopeless. The
government strengthened their bands by failing to
satisfy the people with liberal measures.<a name='FA_XX-20' id='FA_XX-20' href='#FN_XX-20' class='fnanchor'>[XX-20]</a> The discontent
grew apace. Neither the authorities nor
García Granados were idle during 1870, both laying
in a supply of breech-loading rifles.
</p>

<p>
Early in 1871, the liberals of Salvador, with the
assistance of the president of Honduras, overthrew the
government of Dueñas.<a name='FA_XX-21' id='FA_XX-21' href='#FN_XX-21' class='fnanchor'>[XX-21]</a> This was a heavy blow to
the conservatives. García Granados was organizing
an expedition in Chiapas, probably in concert with the
liberals of Salvador, and as soon as Dueñas' downfall
was accomplished, he invaded Guatemala, where he
was joined by J. Rufino Barrios, who, upon the defeat
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_420' name='Page_420' href='#Page_420'>420</a></span>
of Cruz, had retired into Mexican territory. Vicente
Mendez Cruz invaded on the 5th of March at Charulá
and proceeded to the sierra of Nebaj, relying on the
aid of the Indians of Chajul. He was joined by another
party under E. Giron, and together they occupied
Coban, which was ungarrisoned. Barrios with
about sixty men encountered, April 4th, on the Tacaná
heights, a government force, which retreated to
San Márcos. Lastly, Lieutenant-colonel Juan Viteri
joined them with some servants of his hacienda.<a name='FA_XX-22' id='FA_XX-22' href='#FN_XX-22' class='fnanchor'>[XX-22]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
GARCÍA GRANADOS.
</p>

<p>
García Granados, by way of Cuilco and Tejutla,
reached, May 10th, Serchil, distant three leagues from
San Pedro Sacatepequez. He, together with Barrios,
occupied San Márcos, and on the approach of Lieutenant-colonel
Calonge, retreated toward Coatepeque.<a name='FA_XX-23' id='FA_XX-23' href='#FN_XX-23' class='fnanchor'>[XX-23]</a>
The result of the operations was that on June 1st
Calonge, at the head of 800 men, was routed by
García Granados near La Antigua, losing his artillery,
500 rifles, and ammunition. Of the government
troops hardly 100 men got back to the capital. The
people of Jutiapa revolted, and sent a commissioner to
General Gregorio Solares, then at Santa Ana, in
Salvador, to invite him to command a considerable
force for coöperation with García Granados. Solares
lost no time in answering the call.
</p>

<p>
The officers of the liberating army held a meeting
on the 3d of June at the town of Patzicia, and in a
preamble and series of resolutions made known their
purpose to overthrow Cerna and his administration,
and establish a republic based on democratic principles,
to which effect Miguel García Granados was
called to act as provisional president with ample
powers.<a name='FA_XX-24' id='FA_XX-24' href='#FN_XX-24' class='fnanchor'>[XX-24]</a> García Granados had previously made a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_421' name='Page_421' href='#Page_421'>421</a></span>
proclamation to his countrymen detailing the arbitrary
acts of the government, one of which had been the order
to confine him and other representatives of the
people<a name='FA_XX-25' id='FA_XX-25' href='#FN_XX-25' class='fnanchor'>[XX-25]</a> in the dungeons of Fort San José. He was
fortunate, however, in escaping arrest. He now urged
the necessity of overthrowing a despotism under which
the nation could make no progress whatever.<a name='FA_XX-26' id='FA_XX-26' href='#FN_XX-26' class='fnanchor'>[XX-26]</a> Again,
after the pronunciamiento of Patzicia, he issued another
manifesto, pledging himself to labor for the
establishment of a republican government.
</p>

<p>
The troops sent against the insurgents at first made
little or no resistance. They were disaffected men,
and led by lukewarm or faithless officers.<a name='FA_XX-27' id='FA_XX-27' href='#FN_XX-27' class='fnanchor'>[XX-27]</a> Cerna
then took the field with the troops which could be
spared from the defence of the capital, a good portion
being his faithful battalions of Santa Rosa and Chiquimula
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_422' name='Page_422' href='#Page_422'>422</a></span>
Indians; but it was too late. He was in no
condition to cope with the enemy, most of his best
officers having deserted him. There were several
encounters, in only one of which he had any chance
of success. On the 23d of June he surprised the
insurgents on the hills between Totonicapan and
Quezaltenango, in Tierrablanca; his brave Indians
drove back the Quezaltenangos, but Barrios came
with reënforcements of his best troops, and regained
the lost ground. At this moment Cerna was no
longer fit to command, being taken very ill.<a name='FA_XX-28' id='FA_XX-28' href='#FN_XX-28' class='fnanchor'>[XX-28]</a> His
friends hurried him off, and his men were utterly
routed, and made a hasty retreat in the afternoon.
Next morning Colonel Julio García Granados went
in pursuit, and captured nearly 100 prisoners and a
quantity of war material.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
IMPORTANT VICTORY.
</p>

<p>
Cerna reached Chimaltenango, and thought of fortifying
himself there. With reënforcements received
from the capital he now had 2,100 men. The insurgent
army, though increased in Los Altos, was
only 1,200 strong; but it was flushed with victory,
and counted on the superiority of its Remington
and Winchester rifles. García Granados resolved not
to attack Cerna in Chimaltenango, but to march by
way of San Andrés Itzapa to La Antigua, and occupy
the heights of Santa Lucía, thus menacing the capital.<a name='FA_XX-29' id='FA_XX-29' href='#FN_XX-29' class='fnanchor'>[XX-29]</a>
On reaching Chicoj he heard that Cerna was
at La Antigua. Changing his plans, he marched to
Chimaltenango, and thence to Santiago, a town six
leagues from Guatemala, where he spent the night.
In Zumpango he was advised of the occupation of
Amatitlan by Solares, whom he at once directed to
harass Cerna on his march to the capital. Granados'
intent was to meet Cerna on the Mixco road; and to
this end early on the 29th of June repaired to San
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_423' name='Page_423' href='#Page_423'>423</a></span>
Lúcas, to ascertain with certainty the time when Cerna
would pass through Rancho de San Lúcas toward
Bárcenas. He occupied that town, and after a consultation
with his second in command, Barrios, went
with a body of cavalry to the Mixco heights, where
he presently heard shots from the direction of San
Lúcas. Cerna had made ready for the struggle.
Barrios saw victory on the San Lúcas hill; and without
waiting the return of his chief, directed Julio
García Granados with 800 men to support his front,
and rapidly marched with 400, and occupied the hill,
thus winning the day. Cerna's troops, finding their
retreat cut off, disbanded by hundreds, and by nightfall
the number of prisoners and deserters, most of the
latter with their arms, exceeded 1,000.<a name='FA_XX-30' id='FA_XX-30' href='#FN_XX-30' class='fnanchor'>[XX-30]</a> The victory
was complete; for of Cerna's 2,400 men—he had lately
received 400—scarcely 30 entered the capital that
day.<a name='FA_XX-31' id='FA_XX-31' href='#FN_XX-31' class='fnanchor'>[XX-31]</a>
</p>

<p>
The provisional president passed the night in Bárcenas,
and the next morning after the civil authorities
of Guatemala had met him outside and quietly delivered
the keys of the city together with the castle
and barracks, he, accompanied by Barrios, the other
leading officers, and the troops, marched into the capital
amid the most enthusiastic plaudits.<a name='FA_XX-32' id='FA_XX-32' href='#FN_XX-32' class='fnanchor'>[XX-32]</a> With the
exception of a few hostile cries against Cerna, Bolaños,

The task of reorganizing public affairs was an arduous
one.<a name='FA_XX-34' id='FA_XX-34' href='#FN_XX-34' class='fnanchor'>[XX-34]</a> The first attempt to appoint a cabinet was
unsuccessful. Persons who were tendered portfolios
declined them. However, Felipe Galvez, who had
been secretary-general during the campaign, became
minister of foreign affairs, public instruction, and ad

of government, justice, and ecclesiastical affairs.
</p>

<p>
The act of Patzicia was accepted by the principal
towns in the republic, save those of the departments
of Santa Rosa and Chiquimula. The government
decreed several liberal measures, and restored diplomatic
relations with Costa Rica.<a name='FA_XX-35' id='FA_XX-35' href='#FN_XX-35' class='fnanchor'>[XX-35]</a>

DOWNFALL OF THE CLERGY.

<p>
The new administration had hardly initiated reforms
when an insurrection broke out in Santa Rosa, promoted
by the priests and their aristocratic allies. It
does not appear that García Granados had at first intended
open hostility to the religious orders. The
tone of his address, early in September 1871, to the
Santa Rosa Indians, indicated that his plans involved
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_425' name='Page_425' href='#Page_425'>425</a></span>
absolute religious tolerance.<a name='FA_XX-36' id='FA_XX-36' href='#FN_XX-36' class='fnanchor'>[XX-36]</a> The priests would not
rest contented with the loss of their former high standing.<a name='FA_XX-37' id='FA_XX-37' href='#FN_XX-37' class='fnanchor'>[XX-37]</a>
Had they remained quiet, it is not likely they
would have been molested. The president's call on
the insurgents of Santa Rosa to submit was disregarded,
but their movement was quelled by the
end of the month with much bloodshed.<a name='FA_XX-38' id='FA_XX-38' href='#FN_XX-38' class='fnanchor'>[XX-38]</a> An amnesty
was granted to rebels surrendering to the
authorities. The decree of martial law was repealed;
and the ministers then in charge of the executive
made García Granados a captain-general and Barrios
a lieutenant-general.<a name='FA_XX-39' id='FA_XX-39' href='#FN_XX-39' class='fnanchor'>[XX-39]</a>

SUPPRESSION OF RELIGIOUS HOUSES.
</p>

<p class="p2">
The new régime now resolved to cut loose of the
ecclesiastical incubus, and to establish the supremacy
of the civil authority in the state on a firm basis. Its
first step was to carry out a decree of the revolutionary
government, dated May 24, 1870, to expel the
society of Jesus forever from the republic.<a name='FA_XX-40' id='FA_XX-40' href='#FN_XX-40' class='fnanchor'>[XX-40]</a> This was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_426' name='Page_426' href='#Page_426'>426</a></span>
not effected without some scandal and disturbance
from the zealous partisans of the order. Seventy-three
jesuits, most of whom were foreigners, were sent
away on an American steamship, bound to Panamá.<a name='FA_XX-41' id='FA_XX-41' href='#FN_XX-41' class='fnanchor'>[XX-41]</a>
They did not go so far down, however, as will be
shown elsewhere. The decree under which this expulsion
was effected resembled that of April 2, 1767,
issued by Cárlos III.<a name='FA_XX-42' id='FA_XX-42' href='#FN_XX-42' class='fnanchor'>[XX-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
Archbishop Piñol of Guatemala, and Ortiz Urruela,
bishop of Teya in partibus infidelium, for their marked
hostility in promoting rebellion, were, on October 17th,
ordered to leave the country, and they departed without
offering any resistance. The tithes tax was at
once suppressed.<a name='FA_XX-43' id='FA_XX-43' href='#FN_XX-43' class='fnanchor'>[XX-43]</a> On the 7th of June, 1872, religious
communities of men were extinguished, causing great
excitement, but owing to the energy of the government
it soon died out.<a name='FA_XX-44' id='FA_XX-44' href='#FN_XX-44' class='fnanchor'>[XX-44]</a> Nor did the action of the
government stop here. The <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">fuero eclesiástico</span> in both
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_427' name='Page_427' href='#Page_427'>427</a></span>
civil and criminal causes was done away with March
12, 1873, and freedom of worship decreed on the 15th.<a name='FA_XX-45' id='FA_XX-45' href='#FN_XX-45' class='fnanchor'>[XX-45]</a>
</p>

<p>
The turn of the nunneries came at last. On the
28th of February, 1874, it was ordered that all the
nuns should be concentrated in one convent, the
Santa Catarina, and be allowed to receive their families
and friends without hindrance. This convent
was placed under the immediate protection and vigilance
of the civil authorities, which roused the ire of
the ecclesiastics, who endeavored to nullify the order.<a name='FA_XX-46' id='FA_XX-46' href='#FN_XX-46' class='fnanchor'>[XX-46]</a>
The consequence was, that in February 1874, President
Barrios decreed the suppression of many religious
houses, prohibiting professions in the future, and permitting
nuns who so desired to leave the cloister, and
to each one so departing would be given a monthly
allowance of twenty dollars. On the 3d of March
the nuns residing in Santa Catarina were put out of
the cloister.<a name='FA_XX-47' id='FA_XX-47' href='#FN_XX-47' class='fnanchor'>[XX-47]</a>
</p>

<p class="p2">
The aspect of public affairs in Central America at
the inception of 1872 was not promising of stability
and peace. Honduras, together with Archbishop
Piñol, Bishop Ortiz Urruela, the jesuits, and their
conservative friends, all combined, had assumed a reactionary
attitude, with the avowed intent of upsetting
the governments which were laboring to consolidate
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_428' name='Page_428' href='#Page_428'>428</a></span>
democratic principles, and serious complications were
apprehended.<a name='FA_XX-48' id='FA_XX-48' href='#FN_XX-48' class='fnanchor'>[XX-48]</a> The two governments thus menaced
were, however, fully prepared for the emergency.<a name='FA_XX-49' id='FA_XX-49' href='#FN_XX-49' class='fnanchor'>[XX-49]</a>
</p>

<p>
President Medina, of Honduras, having become the
leader of the reactionary element, Guatemala and Salvador
entered into a treaty of alliance and despatched
troops against him, after a formal declaration of war.<a name='FA_XX-50' id='FA_XX-50' href='#FN_XX-50' class='fnanchor'>[XX-50]</a>
The president took command of the Guatemalan troops
for the campaign, leaving the executive office temporarily
in charge of Barrios. The war was but a short
one, ending advantageously for the allies, who, after
concluding a satisfactory arrangement, retired their
troops. García Granados returned to Guatemala on
the 10th of June, and reassumed his executive duties,
Barrios going to Quezaltenango as comandante general
of Los Altos.<a name='FA_XX-51' id='FA_XX-51' href='#FN_XX-51' class='fnanchor'>[XX-51]</a> The cabinet was now organized,
as appears in the note at foot.<a name='FA_XX-52' id='FA_XX-52' href='#FN_XX-52' class='fnanchor'>[XX-52]</a> The reactionists would
not keep still. Colonel Vicente Mendez Cruz, jefe

insurrection.<a name='FA_XX-53' id='FA_XX-53' href='#FN_XX-53' class='fnanchor'>[XX-53]</a>

<p>
The reactionary forces took the name of "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">ejército de

avowed object was to bring Cerna back to uphold
their rights and religion, which they claimed to have
been assailed by heretical rulers. The government

begin April 20th, and last seven days. The term for
which the elect should hold the office was to be established
by the new charter, taking into account the
time already served. The assembly was to be summoned
for the 5th of May, to count the votes. The
election took place, and Justo Rufino Barrios was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_430' name='Page_430' href='#Page_430'>430</a></span>
declared by the assembly on May 7th to have been
popularly elected. He was formally inducted into
office on the 4th of June, 1873.<a name='FA_XX-58' id='FA_XX-58' href='#FN_XX-58' class='fnanchor'>[XX-58]</a>
</p>

<p>
The late administration must be held to have been
somewhat weak. García Granados was an enlightened
and able man, but easy, unassuming, indolent,
and kind-hearted; too much so, indeed, for the place
he had been called to fill at a period demanding of
him great energy, and an unbending will. His was
not a disposition to deal harshly with any one, or inflict
suffering. Another drawback was his connection
by the ties of family and early association with the
men and women who were laboring to undo the work
of the revolution he had accomplished. Among his
own relatives were some of his most strenuous opponents.
The reactionists took advantage of his good
nature to keep the country in a turmoil, hoping thus
to restore the old régime of fanaticism and general
retrogression. They defeated themselves, however,
bringing into existence the iron power of Barrios, who
tolerated no opposition to his will, nor overlooked
sedition in any form.

<p>
Justo Rufino Barrios, now president of the republic
by the popular choice, was born about 1834 in San
Márcos, department of Quezaltenango. He received
his education in Guatemala, and fitted himself for a
notary public, and received his commission as such;
but it does not appear that he performed notarial duties.<a name='FA_XXI-1' id='FA_XXI-1' href='#FN_XXI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-1]</a>
He was of about middle height, and rather light
complexion, with a cold, distant look, and plain and
unassuming in his dress. His manners were brusque,
unrefined, and unconventional, as if it were easier for
him to despise good manners than to acquire them.
However, after a while they become more polished.
Without any claim to enlightenment, or to a knowledge
of public affairs,<a name='FA_XXI-2' id='FA_XXI-2' href='#FN_XXI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-2]</a> it is not too much to say that
he possessed natural talents, a far-reaching mind, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_432' name='Page_432' href='#Page_432'>432</a></span>
a disposition to labor unremittingly for the welfare of
his country, though at the same time looking after his
own aggrandizement. His energy of character and
iron will have been generally recognized. Whatever
his enemies may say, the fact stands that his country
owes him much; for example, liberal institutions, internal
peace, and with them the advancement of intellectual
pursuits, industries, and wealth.<a name='FA_XXI-3' id='FA_XXI-3' href='#FN_XXI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
The cause of education was fostered as it had never
been before, efforts being constantly made to elevate
the lower classes;<a name='FA_XXI-4' id='FA_XXI-4' href='#FN_XXI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-4]</a> and the country was endowed with
many of the improvements of the age, like the railroad
and the telegraph. Acts of despotism and brutality
without number have been rightly imputed to Barrios,<a name='FA_XXI-5' id='FA_XXI-5' href='#FN_XXI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-5]</a>
some well founded, but most of them inventions of
his enemies, among whom were of course the would-be
oligarchs and the priests, together with their fanatical
followers. Still, it must be said that his government
was one in which fear of the sword was constantly
holding its opponents in check.<a name='FA_XXI-6' id='FA_XXI-6' href='#FN_XXI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-6]</a>

COSTLY INSULT.
</p>

<p>
The efforts of the reactionists to regain the upper-hand
were finally defeated in the latter end of the
year, when an amnesty was granted to the remnants
of rebels in Santa Rosa and elsewhere.<a name='FA_XXI-7' id='FA_XXI-7' href='#FN_XXI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-7]</a> In the following
year an outrageous act was perpetrated by a
military officer, bringing upon his government a serious
complication with a foreign power. Colonel Gonzalez,
a native of Spain, who had been intrusted with
the responsible command at the port of San José, for
some disagreement with the British vice-consul, had
him seized and beaten as a common criminal in the
most barbarous manner. Realizing, on the next
morning, the responsibility he had incurred, he tried
to escape on the American mail steamship, but his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_434' name='Page_434' href='#Page_434'>434</a></span>
infamous conduct had preceded him, and he was
driven away. Both he and his accomplice, Bulnes,
were promptly arrested, tried, and sentenced to undergo
heavy penalties.<a name='FA_XXI-8' id='FA_XXI-8' href='#FN_XXI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-8]</a> The British government
demanded prompt reparation of the insult, which Barrios
unhesitatingly acceded to. Guatemala saluted
the British flag at San José with every mark of respect,<a name='FA_XXI-9' id='FA_XXI-9' href='#FN_XXI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-9]</a>
and was mulcted in the sum of $50,000, which
she paid.<a name='FA_XXI-10' id='FA_XXI-10' href='#FN_XXI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-10]</a>
</p>

<p>
The government had another foreign difficulty on
its hands in 1875, resulting from a hasty recognition
of the independence of Cuba on the 6th of April. In
August, Commodore E. Butler, of the Spanish royal
navy, arrived at Guatemala, bearing a note from
Conde de Valmaseda, captain-general of the island,
to President Barrios, demanding satisfaction. It
was finally agreed<a name='FA_XXI-11' id='FA_XXI-11' href='#FN_XXI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-11]</a> that Guatemala would at once
accredit a minister at Madrid to discuss the subject
and arrange it satisfactorily. This was done, and the
difficulty was amicably settled.<a name='FA_XXI-12' id='FA_XXI-12' href='#FN_XXI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-12]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
FURTHER HOSTILITIES.
</p>

<p>
The political outlook at the beginning of 1876 was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_435' name='Page_435' href='#Page_435'>435</a></span>
not such a one as promised a continuance of peace.
Serious troubles were impending over three of the
important sections of Central America. Barrios had
brought about the assembling of a diet, which was
installed in Guatemala January 15th, with the object
of reorganizing the country under one government.<a name='FA_XXI-13' id='FA_XXI-13' href='#FN_XXI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-13]</a>
Civil war raged in Honduras, and while the diet was
sitting, Barrios was moving his troops; 600 men were
stationed in Esquipulas, and 1,200 more marched to
Jutiapa.<a name='FA_XXI-14' id='FA_XXI-14' href='#FN_XXI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-14]</a> Salvador was not slow in preparing for
hostilities. On the 23d of January, however, Guatemala
and Salvador agreed to disarm.<a name='FA_XXI-15' id='FA_XXI-15' href='#FN_XXI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
It was believed in Guatemala that Enrique Palacios,
and about 3,000 of her refugees sojourning in
Salvador, had been wheedled and promised aid by
President Gonzalez for the overthrow of Barrios, and
that they were exasperated, and would insist on those
promises being carried out. On the other hand, Barrios
was chagrined at the failure of the diet to arrive
at a conclusion in favor of consolidation.<a name='FA_XXI-16' id='FA_XXI-16' href='#FN_XXI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-16]</a> He now
resolved, whether with the purpose of pursuing the
reorganization scheme or with that of further securing
himself, or both, to change the rulers of Salvador
and Honduras, replacing them with his supporters.
The task in Honduras was an easier one, that country
being in the throes of revolution. Salvador, as
he thought, with a hostile government in Honduras,
and war threatening from the side of Guatemala,
must succumb. The results of his policy were as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_436' name='Page_436' href='#Page_436'>436</a></span>
he had planned them. The fortune of war favored
him,<a name='FA_XXI-17' id='FA_XXI-17' href='#FN_XXI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-17]</a> and from 1876 to 1884 he could count on the
resources of Guatemala, Salvador, and Honduras<a name='FA_XXI-18' id='FA_XXI-18' href='#FN_XXI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-18]</a> to
effect what he undertook to accomplish single-handed
at another time. But this will be treated of at the
proper time.
</p>

<p>
After his successful campaign, Barrios was received
in triumph at his capital,<a name='FA_XXI-19' id='FA_XXI-19' href='#FN_XXI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-19]</a> and erelong other honors
poured upon him. Costa Rica made him a general
of division of her army.<a name='FA_XXI-20' id='FA_XXI-20' href='#FN_XXI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-20]</a> The constituent assembly
declared him a benemérito de la patria; and the legislature
of conquered Salvador voted him a sword of
honor.<a name='FA_XXI-21' id='FA_XXI-21' href='#FN_XXI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-21]</a> The political atmosphere, however, became
cloudy immediately after the return of the forces.
Barrios would have dismissed his ministers then
had they not been preparing their reports to present
to the constituent assembly which was to assemble in
a short time.<a name='FA_XXI-22' id='FA_XXI-22' href='#FN_XXI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-22]</a>
</p>

<p>
The assembly was installed on the 11th of September,
1876,<a name='FA_XXI-23' id='FA_XXI-23' href='#FN_XXI-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-23]</a> and passed a few acts; namely, October
19th, approved all the acts of Barrios during the time
he had held the executive office, and his budget for
the fiscal year from July 1, 1876, to June 30, 1877;
October 23d, declared that the proper time for framing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_437' name='Page_437' href='#Page_437'>437</a></span>
a national constitution had not yet arrived; the
work was therefore postponed to a more suitable
period. The presidential term for Barrios was fixed
at four years from the date of the decree.<a name='FA_XXI-24' id='FA_XXI-24' href='#FN_XXI-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-24]</a> The
change of ministers Barrios desired to make finally

MURDEROUS PLOT.
</p>

<p>
With the exception of an insignificant affair in Quiché,
the year 1877 had nearly run itself out without
any alarms or disturbances, when on the 1st of November
a plot was detected in the capital, having for
its objects, as appeared, to murder the president and
other leading men, sack the city, and effect a general
change in affairs. The persons implicated were tried
by court-martial and convicted; seventeen of the chief
leaders being executed in the plaza de armas, and
accomplices of a lower degree sentenced to other penalties.
Most of the latter were subsequently pardoned.<a name='FA_XXI-26' id='FA_XXI-26' href='#FN_XXI-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-26]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_438' name='Page_438' href='#Page_438'>438</a></span>
</p>

<p>
On the 9th of November, 1878, the president issued
a convocation for a constituent assembly of 71 members
to meet on the 15th of March following, for the
purposes of framing a national constitution, and resolving
upon such matters as the government would
submit to its deliberations.<a name='FA_XXI-27' id='FA_XXI-27' href='#FN_XXI-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-27]</a> The assembly was installed
on the appointed day, and the president, whose
term of appointment in 1876 had not expired, surrendered
his dictatorial powers. In a lengthy message
he gave a detailed account of public affairs, with
the assurance that the republic was enjoying peace
and prosperity.<a name='FA_XXI-28' id='FA_XXI-28' href='#FN_XXI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-28]</a> For further particulars he referred
to the reports of his ministers. This much-valued
peace continued uninterrupted, notwithstanding the
efforts of refugees in Chiapas to invade Guatemala
with views hostile to the government. But they were
balked by the action of Mexico at Barrios' request,
in keeping the parties away from the frontier.<a name='FA_XXI-29' id='FA_XXI-29' href='#FN_XXI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-29]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_439' name='Page_439' href='#Page_439'>439</a></span>
constituent assembly adopted on the 11th of December,
1879, a new constitution for the republic, which was
promulgated a few days after. It recognized the
great principles of democracy and social reform, and
was in harmony with the social condition and political
needs of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XXI-30' id='FA_XXI-30' href='#FN_XXI-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-30]</a>

BARRIOS DICTATOR.
</p>

<p>
Pursuant to the requirements of the constitution,
the government issued on the 13th of December, 1879,
and 12th of January, 1880, decrees for the elections
of president of the republic and deputies to the assembly,
which took place without any disturbance. Justo
Rufino Barrios was chosen, by popular suffrage, president
of the republic for the term from March 1, 1880,
to March 1, 1886.<a name='FA_XXI-31' id='FA_XXI-31' href='#FN_XXI-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-31]</a> Peace continued without interruption,<a name='FA_XXI-32' id='FA_XXI-32' href='#FN_XXI-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-32]</a>
and the government was enabled to devote
its attention to the advancement of the country's educational
and material interests. Judicial and administrative
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_440' name='Page_440' href='#Page_440'>440</a></span>
reforms were introduced, and the army was
reorganized, receiving marked improvements in every
branch. Agriculture and commerce progressed, and
the national finances had never been in so promising a
condition.<a name='FA_XXI-33' id='FA_XXI-33' href='#FN_XXI-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-33]</a>
</p>

<p>
Barrios took advantage of this quiet to pay a visit
to the United States. He landed at New Orleans,
and thence repaired to Washington, where he was received
with the high consideration due to the chief
magistrate of a friendly nation. In other cities of the
union he was also welcomed and hospitably entertained.<a name='FA_XXI-34' id='FA_XXI-34' href='#FN_XXI-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-34]</a>
His visit was one of business rather than of
pleasure, having the double object of inviting the
American government, Mexico having likewise done
so, to act as mediator for the final settlement of their
long-pending boundary question; and also of bespeaking
the influence and good offices of the same power
to bring about the union of the five Central American
states, in order that they might form a single republic.
The first request was acceded to, and the boundary
difficulty was terminated.<a name='FA_XXI-35' id='FA_XXI-35' href='#FN_XXI-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-35]</a> As regarded the other
matter, the United States, while recognizing the wisdom
of the five Central American republics becoming
consolidated, declined to interfere.

BARRIOS RESTLESS.

<p>
Barrios made a flying visit to Europe, and returned
by way of the United States, embarking at San Francisco,
California, for his country, where he arrived
early in November 1882.<a name='FA_XXI-36' id='FA_XXI-36' href='#FN_XXI-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-36]</a> On the 29th of December
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_441' name='Page_441' href='#Page_441'>441</a></span>
he laid before the legislative assembly, then sitting
in extra session, his resignation of the executive office,
pleading the precarious state of his health, which demanded
rest and special care. He said that the constitutional
régime being restored and consolidated, his
further services might be dispensed with. He considered
the occasion a propitious one for a change in
the chief magistrate.<a name='FA_XXI-37' id='FA_XXI-37' href='#FN_XXI-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-37]</a>
</p>

<p>
Barrios' act caused much anxiety to his friends,<a name='FA_XXI-38' id='FA_XXI-38' href='#FN_XXI-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-38]</a>
but the assembly, while appreciating his motives, declined
to accept the resignation, alluding to the alarm
the news of it had created among the people. It did
not seem to concur with him on the point of internal
peace being secure, apprehension existing against reactionary
projects which might arrest the progress of
the past few years. The chamber promised, however,
to devise some means of conciliating the demands of
his health with the need of his services.<a name='FA_XXI-39' id='FA_XXI-39' href='#FN_XXI-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-39]</a> It was understood
that if the project of the union of the states,
then engaging the attention of their governments,
should be carried out, the measure to be suggested
by the assembly would be granting him a leave of absence.
The decision of the legislature was received
with great satisfaction by the people. Barrios accepted
it, and on the 6th of January, 1883, in an
address to the people, announced his resumption of
the presidency, though only for a short time.<a name='FA_XXI-40' id='FA_XXI-40' href='#FN_XXI-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-40]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_442' name='Page_442' href='#Page_442'>442</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the scheme of Central American reconstruction
had not been neglected. Barrios at an
early day renewed negotiations with that object in
view. Salvador and Honduras seemed to be in full
accord with his plan; but Nicaragua and Costa Rica
had failed to see the practicability of its realization.
Delfino Sanchez, a Guatemalan commissioner, and
Salvador Gallegos, minister of foreign affairs of Salvador,
together visited Honduras, whose president,
ministers, and influential citizens renewed assurances
of concerted action. They next repaired to Nicaragua,
and then to Costa Rica, at both of which places
they met with cordial receptions, and their propositions
were attentively considered, leading them to
expect a successful result to their joint mission.<a name='FA_XXI-41' id='FA_XXI-41' href='#FN_XXI-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-41]</a>
Those governments consented to accredit five delegates
each to a congress, which was to sit in March
1884, either at Ahuachapan, or Santa Tecla, in Salvador,
with powers limited to discuss and subscribe to
the plan for a general constitution, and organic laws
intended for the reorganization of Central America.
Costa Rica's promise was subject to sanction by her
legislature. She subsequently receded, and officially
made it known to the government of Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XXI-42' id='FA_XXI-42' href='#FN_XXI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
The project was early in 1884 as far from realization
as ever. Barrios in his message of that year to the
national assembly alludes to the result as a sore disappointment
to him; adding that no one had dared to
declare himself against the lofty idea, and yet there
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_443' name='Page_443' href='#Page_443'>443</a></span>
had been so many elements, both of personal ambition
and localism, hostile to its success,<a name='FA_XXI-43' id='FA_XXI-43' href='#FN_XXI-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-43]</a> that the use of
force would have had to be resorted to, which had
formed no part of his peaceful plan, to conquer the
covert and persistent opposition. But his government
would not let slip any opportunity favorable to its
realization, continuing meantime with its liberal institutions,
laws, and general policy, to exhibit unequivocal
proofs of a fraternal spirit. He soon had a falling
out, however, with President Soto of Honduras, who,
believing himself in peril of overthrow, or other form
of revenge, at the hands of his more powerful neighbor,
was charged with abandoning his slippery position,
and seeking safety in a foreign land, well provided with
pecuniary means to lead a luxurious life. But on this
subject more particulars are given in connection with
Honduras history in another chapter.
</p>

<p>
With Nicaragua a general treaty of friendship, defensive
alliance, commerce, navigation, and extradition
of criminals was concluded at Guatemala, December
27, 1883.<a name='FA_XXI-44' id='FA_XXI-44' href='#FN_XXI-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-44]</a>

ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION.
</p>

<p>
An attempt was made, with a metallic bomb, against
the life of President Barrios, as he was walking in
the Plaza del Teatro with the minister of war, J.
Martin Barrundia, on the evening of April 13, 1884.
The bomb burst, happily, failing of its object. No
one was injured; but the incident served to excite
alarm and indignation against the perpetrators of the
crime throughout Central America. Expressions of
sympathy and congratulation at the narrow escape of
Barrios and his companion, came in from the diplomatic
corps, and from all classes of society.<a name='FA_XXI-45' id='FA_XXI-45' href='#FN_XXI-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-45]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_444' name='Page_444' href='#Page_444'>444</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The investigations made by the authorities led to the
discovery of the perpetrators, and they were tried,
convicted, and sentenced.<a name='FA_XXI-46' id='FA_XXI-46' href='#FN_XXI-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-46]</a> But the president, exercising
his prerogative, granted them a full pardon on
the 4th of July, and they were at once set at liberty.
</p>

<p>
Barrios, who had been visiting the western departments,
returned to the capital on September 13th,
having with him as national guests the presidents of
Salvador and Honduras with their suites, and Tomás
Ayon, representing the chief magistrate of Nicaragua,
who had been unable to respond in person to the invitation
of the government of Guatemala, and be present
with the others at the inauguration of the southern
railroad.<a name='FA_XXI-47' id='FA_XXI-47' href='#FN_XXI-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-47]</a> The visit of these personages lasted till the
termination of the festivities, when they took their
departure the 21st; Barrios and his ministers accompanying
them as far as Port San José.
</p>

<p>
The scheme of Central American unification was
never lost sight of. Barrios had been watching for a
propitious opportunity, and early in 1885 resolved to
initiate it. He accordingly issued, on the 28th of
February, a decree wherein, after explaining in a long
preamble the advantages which would accrue to all
concerned from his action, he proclaimed, in accord
with the legislative assembly of Guatemala, the consolidation
of the five states into one republic, and the
manner of effecting it.<a name='FA_XXI-48' id='FA_XXI-48' href='#FN_XXI-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-48]</a> He likewise made a manifesto
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_445' name='Page_445' href='#Page_445'>445</a></span>
to the people of Central America at large, assuring
them that he was not prompted by personal ambition,
or the desire of holding power, for he had had abundant
experience of its bitterness.<a name='FA_XXI-49' id='FA_XXI-49' href='#FN_XXI-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-49]</a>
</p>

<p>
The president of Honduras on the 7th of March
telegraphed to Guatemala the resolutions adopted
that same day by the state assembly in favor of Central
American consolidation.<a name='FA_XXI-50' id='FA_XXI-50' href='#FN_XXI-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-50]</a>

DIVERSIFIED OPINIONS.
</p>

<p>
The people of Guatemala and Honduras seemed to
be generally disposed to support their governments.
But it proved to be otherwise in Salvador, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica, though many citizens of the three
states favored the initiative of Guatemala. The administration
of Salvador having failed to second the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_446' name='Page_446' href='#Page_446'>446</a></span>
movement, Barrios' passionate temper was roused. He
wrote President Zaldívar that, relying upon the assurances
of Salvador and Honduras,<a name='FA_XXI-51' id='FA_XXI-51' href='#FN_XXI-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-51]</a> he had launched
his decree of February 28th, and as he had not shown
the proper disposition to fulfil his pledges, the government
of Guatemala would employ its abundant resources
to force compliance;<a name='FA_XXI-52' id='FA_XXI-52' href='#FN_XXI-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-52]</a> for he was resolved to
carry out his enterprise at all hazards. He announced
at the same time the appointment of Francisco Menendez,
a Salvadoran general of division, to command
the western departments of the latter republic,<a name='FA_XXI-53' id='FA_XXI-53' href='#FN_XXI-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-53]</a> with
instructions to raise over them the standard of Central
America, and expressed the hope that Zaldívar would
not permit obstacles to be thrown in that officer's way.
Zaldívar telegraphed him on the 9th to await the
visit of their mutual friends, Menendez and Avilez,
and not act hastily, nor look upon him as a foe, for he
had no wish to be one. Barrios then concluded to
wait for the coming of those commissioners.<a name='FA_XXI-54' id='FA_XXI-54' href='#FN_XXI-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-54]</a>

COERCION CONDEMNED.
</p>

<p>
The decree of February 28th, which was now raising
such a political storm, had been officially communicated
to the foreign diplomatic and consular corps on the
6th of March. The German minister was the first to
answer it; he seemed to commend the effort about to
be made. The other representatives acknowledged
its receipt in more or less expressive terms. The
Spanish minister endeavored, however, though unofficially,
to dissuade Barrios from carrying out his plan
without the concurrence of the other states. His effort,
he said, was to avert bloodshed. Barrios was
indisposed to brook this interference, returning on the
10th a haughty reply to the effect that the question of
Central American unification was not an international
one, and solely concerned the people of Central America.
He therefore requested him to discontinue his
officious intervention, and finally added, that if Zaldívar
fulfilled his engagements, paying attention only to the
wishes of patriotic citizens, there would be no bloodshed.
The minister then went to Guatemala, and
wrote an explanatory letter, closing his interference,
to which Barrios replied that, being engaged with
other important affairs, he could not give his letter all
the attention it demanded; but he was glad the discussion
had been brought to an end. The government
of Mexico, to which the Guatemalan minister, Francisco
Anguiano, had made known Barrios' action,
replied through its minister of foreign affairs, Ignacio
Mariscal, disapproving of the movement, and signifying
its intention to provide for the defence of Mexico's
frontiers and interests.<a name='FA_XXI-55' id='FA_XXI-55' href='#FN_XXI-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-55]</a>
</p>

<p>
The government of the United States also looked
with disfavor on the plan of forcible organization,
promptly ordering naval forces to the Central American
coasts for the protection of American interests.
The Nicaraguan congress had, on the 8th of March,
resolved to reject the union decreed by Guatemala,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_448' name='Page_448' href='#Page_448'>448</a></span>
and to energetically oppose what they called Barrios'
attempt to impose his will, and to constitute himself a
dictator over Central America. The executive was
accordingly empowered to make provision, singly or
conjointly with other states, for national defence at
whatever sacrifice. The government of Costa Rica
adopted a similar course, the executive being clothed
with extraordinary powers.<a name='FA_XXI-56' id='FA_XXI-56' href='#FN_XXI-56' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-56]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DEATH OF BARRIOS.
</p>

<p>
Finally, the three republics of Salvador, Nicaragua,
and Costa Rica appealed to the governments of the
United States and Mexico to interfere on their behalf
against Barrios' projects. Mexico responded at once.
President Diaz notified Barrios on the 10th by telegraph,
that the governments and people of those three
republics had rejected his scheme, which had, moreover,
produced an impression on the Mexican people,
demanding on the part of their government the assumption
of an attitude suitable to an emergency by
which the independence and autonomy of nations of
this continent had been menaced. Barrios telegraphed
back that his answer would go by mail. He afterward
issued an address to the Mexican nation, of a
friendly nature.<a name='FA_XXI-57' id='FA_XXI-57' href='#FN_XXI-57' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-57]</a> But the die was cast. War was
now unavoidable. The three opposing governments,
for their mutual protection, entered on the 22d of
March into an alliance offensive and defensive,<a name='FA_XXI-58' id='FA_XXI-58' href='#FN_XXI-58' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-58]</a> and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_449' name='Page_449' href='#Page_449'>449</a></span>
took active measures to give effect to the union.
Guatemala on her part, and her ally Honduras, had
not been slow in their preparations for the impending
strife. Regardless of all opposition, Barrios was still
bent upon his difficult task, and for its accomplishment
marched an army into Salvadoran territory.
The events of this campaign are given in another
chapter, in connection with the history of Salvador,
where the fighting took place. Let it suffice to say
here that the invaders met with disaster, and Barrios
lost his life, fighting heroically, on the 2d of April.<a name='FA_XXI-59' id='FA_XXI-59' href='#FN_XXI-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-59]</a>
His remains were rescued, it is said at the cost of
twenty lives, and conveyed to Guatemala, where they
were interred with civic and military honors. His
widow, Francisca Aparicio de Barrios, and their seven
children, being escorted to the port of San José by a
military guard, embarked for San Francisco, accompanied
by friends. They afterward transferred themselves
and their belongings to New York, where
Señora Barrios established her residence, it being understood
that the family has been left amply provided
with pecuniary means.<a name='FA_XXI-60' id='FA_XXI-60' href='#FN_XXI-60' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-60]</a>
</p>

<p>
Upon the news reaching Guatemala of the disasters
which had befallen the army operating in Salvador,
and of the death of the president, the legislative assembly,
and the provisional president, Alejandro Sinibaldi,<a name='FA_XXI-61' id='FA_XXI-61' href='#FN_XXI-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-61]</a>
in accord with it, revoked on the 3d of April
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_450' name='Page_450' href='#Page_450'>450</a></span>
the decree of February 28th. Subsequently, through
the mediation of the diplomatic corps, preliminaries
of peace were agreed to, but not before the president
of Salvador had signified an unwillingness to treat
with Sinibaldi and Barrios' ministers. The former
then surrendered the executive office to the second
designado, Manuel Lisandro Barillas, and the ministers
retired with him.
</p>

<p>
The new government on the 15th of April restored
peace with Salvador and her allies Nicaragua and
Costa Rica.<a name='FA_XXI-62' id='FA_XXI-62' href='#FN_XXI-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-62]</a> All treaty stipulations existing between
Guatemala and Salvador on the 28th of February last
were also restored, to remain in force until a new
treaty should be concluded.<a name='FA_XXI-63' id='FA_XXI-63' href='#FN_XXI-63' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-63]</a> An amnesty was granted
to all Guatemalans who took part in the late president's
movement, and to all Guatemalans who were
absent for political offences committed six months
prior to the aforesaid date; the government signifying
its intention of making the amnesty general as
soon as circumstances would permit.<a name='FA_XXI-64' id='FA_XXI-64' href='#FN_XXI-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-64]</a> With the

PEACE AT LAST.
</p>

<p>
The cabinet of Salvador now proposed to the other
four republics the meeting of a congress of plenipotentiaries
on the 15th of May at Santa Tecla, with the
object of reconstructing Central America as one republic,
or at least of adopting measures conducive to
that end. President Zaldívar then signified his intention
of resigning his office on the assembling of congress,
and as soon as it should have arrived at some
resolution on the scheme. Guatemala deemed it premature.
Nicaragua declined. Honduras accepted
the proposition. The government of Costa Rica,
though her magistrate was clothed with ample powers,
did not feel justified in entering into such an
arrangement without first obtaining the assent of congress,
which was not then in session, and would not
be for some time.<a name='FA_XXI-66' id='FA_XXI-66' href='#FN_XXI-66' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-66]</a>
</p>

<p>
Peace and quiet being generally reëstablished, martial
law was removed, the country placed under the
rule of the constitution, a general amnesty decreed,
and a constituent congress convoked.<a name='FA_XXI-67' id='FA_XXI-67' href='#FN_XXI-67' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-67]</a> Congress assembled
on the 24th of August, the acting president
manifesting much confidence in its wisdom to accomplish
much good to the country. But it does not
appear that after a long session, it accomplished any
thing worth recording.<a name='FA_XXI-68' id='FA_XXI-68' href='#FN_XXI-68' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-68]</a>
</p>

<p>
The election took place on the 22d of November,
Barillas being chosen president by a unanimous vote
of the electoral college. Colonel Vicente Castañeda,
a deputy, was elected vice-president.<a name='FA_XXI-69' id='FA_XXI-69' href='#FN_XXI-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXI-69]</a> Barillas was
quite the opposite of Barrios in some respects. He
was a man of the kindest and most benevolent instincts,
who would rather suffer wrong than do wrong. The
discontented were not long in taking advantage of his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_452' name='Page_452' href='#Page_452'>452</a></span>
clemency to create disturbance. A number of generals
and others were detected in a diabolical plot, intended
to murder Barillas and destroy the foreigners.
The parties implicated were arrested, and surrendered
to the courts, the president refusing to interfere.
</p>

<p>
The ministers were requested to resign their portfolios,
which were intrusted to the following persons,
all young men of recognized abilities and progressive
ideas, namely: A. Lazo Arriaga, of foreign relations;
Abel Cruz, of government and justice; Escobar, of
the treasury and public credit; Cárlos Herrera, a son
of the late Manuel M. Herrera, one of Barrios' best
assistants, minister of fomento; and Manuel Valle,
journalist, poet, and orator, minister of public instruction.

<p>
There is very little to record for Honduras in the
five years from 1865 to 1870; the country enjoyed
comparative peace under the same conservative system
existing in Guatemala and Salvador. President Medina
being reëlected was again inducted into office on
the 1st of February, 1866, and a few days later the
military rank of lieutenant-general was conferred on
him.<a name='FA_XXII-1' id='FA_XXII-1' href='#FN_XXII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-1]</a> On the 16th of the same month congress decreed
a change in the national coat of arms and flag,
in the manner described at foot.<a name='FA_XXII-2' id='FA_XXII-2' href='#FN_XXII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-2]</a>
</p>

<p>
Early in 1868 Medina and congress, with the approbation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_454' name='Page_454' href='#Page_454'>454</a></span>
of the council of state,<a name='FA_XXII-3' id='FA_XXII-3' href='#FN_XXII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-3]</a> resolved upon the creation
of an order of merit to reward important civil,
military, and religious services rendered to the nation,
and other praiseworthy acts of its citizens. Congress
then on the 21st of February established the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Órden
de Santa Rosa y de la Civilizacion de Honduras</span>.<a name='FA_XXII-4' id='FA_XXII-4' href='#FN_XXII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-4]</a>
The executive promulgated the decree on the 24th
with the signature appended of Trinidad Ferrari, minister
of the interior. The idea met with the approval
of some, and excited the ridicule of others. The order
soon fell into discredit, many unworthy persons having
obtained it, and its suppression was decreed.<a name='FA_XXII-5' id='FA_XXII-5' href='#FN_XXII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
Medina was chosen president for another term of
four years. In order to do this, the clause in article
33 of the national constitution forbidding reëlection
for the next immediate period was repealed, which
Medina's partisans effected through a constituent assembly
convoked ad hoc.<a name='FA_XXII-6' id='FA_XXII-6' href='#FN_XXII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-6]</a> He was accordingly reinaugurated
February 1, 1870.
</p>

<p>
Honduras was now to experience another series of
troubles, which lasted several years. In the last days
of December 1869, disturbances were apprehended in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_455' name='Page_455' href='#Page_455'>455</a></span>
Olancho and Paraiso, in connivance with Nicaraguan
exiles, for which reason those refugees were concentrated
in Comayagua. Some seditious attempts were
made in the following year, but were easily put down.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
TROUBLES WITH SALVADOR.
</p>

<p>
Early in 1871, serious differences existed between
the governments of Honduras and Salvador, or, to be
more exact, between presidents Medina and Dueñas,
on several points. The causes, as well as the fruitless
efforts made by Honduran commissioners in San
Salvador to effect a peaceable settlement of long-existing
differences, are fully explained elsewhere.<a name='FA_XXII-7' id='FA_XXII-7' href='#FN_XXII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-7]</a>
Medina, on the 7th of February, declared all treaties
between the two republics suspended, and war
soon broke out. A Salvadoran army, under General
Xatruch, invaded Honduras and took Comayagua,
that commander styling himself provisional
president. The Honduran government had entered
into a correspondence with the United States ministers
resident at Tegucigalpa and San Salvador, calling
their attention to the 14th article of the treaty of July
4, 1864, between their nation and Honduras, under
which the former recognized the rights of ownership
and sovereignty of the latter in the line of the Honduras
interoceanic railway, the works on which, it said,
were in danger of interruption by the Salvadoran invaders.
From the tenor of its notes, it would seem
as if it expected the United States to hoist their flag
over Comayagua, which might have hindered the operations
of Xatruch. Medina's pretension was untenable,
the understanding being that the obligation of
the United States did not attach till after the completion
of the work.<a name='FA_XXII-8' id='FA_XXII-8' href='#FN_XXII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-8]</a> Moreover, the Honduran government
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_456' name='Page_456' href='#Page_456'>456</a></span>
could not reasonably expect that those ministers
had an armed force at their command. The United
States had no need, even if willing to accept the duty
of protecting those works, to adopt any measures, being
assured by the Salvadoran government that the
neutrality of the Honduras railway would not be interfered
with in any manner.
</p>

<p>
Medina was not idle in devising means to injure the
enemy. He occupied Sensuntepeque on March 17th,
and next Ilobasco. Dueñas' forces under General
Tomás Martinez attacked the latter place on the 19th,
and being repulsed retreated to Cojutepeque. General
Santiago Gonzalez with Hondurans and disaffected
Salvadorans occupied San Vicente on the 19th, the
reserve remaining in Sensuntepeque, which revolted
against Dueñas.<a name='FA_XXII-9' id='FA_XXII-9' href='#FN_XXII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-9]</a> The campaign in Salvador ended at
Santa Ana, where the fate of Dueñas' government
was decided.<a name='FA_XXII-10' id='FA_XXII-10' href='#FN_XXII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-10]</a> Peace was then concluded between
the new government of Salvador and that of Honduras.
Medina started after Xatruch, who then had
about 700 men in Gracias; but the news of the result
at Santa Ana reaching there his troops deserted him.
The war was soon over, Xatruch himself in a proclamation
of May 11th signifying his intention to
leave the country. After this the political situation
was for a while satisfactory. Still Medina deemed it
expedient to invite a plebiscite, and ascertain if the
people wished him to continue at the head of affairs
the rest of his term.<a name='FA_XXII-11' id='FA_XXII-11' href='#FN_XXII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-11]</a> The result was as he desired it.
</p>

<p>
A great commotion was caused in August by 300
or 400 Indians and revolutionists, against whom the
government forces never obtained but partial successes.
The disturbance lasted until an understanding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_457' name='Page_457' href='#Page_457'>457</a></span>
was arrived at with the rebel leaders on the 13th of
December.<a name='FA_XXII-12' id='FA_XXII-12' href='#FN_XXII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-12]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PERPETUAL WAR.
</p>

<p>
Further trouble was impending, this time between
Medina and the liberal governments lately established
in Salvador and Guatemala. He claimed of Salvador
an indemnity for his services in overthrowing Dueñas,
which that government deemed preposterous and disallowed.
The two governments, which had entered
into an alliance offensive and defensive, on the other
hand accused Medina of having formed a coalition
with the oligarchs to restore the latter to power.<a name='FA_XXII-13' id='FA_XXII-13' href='#FN_XXII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-13]</a>
</p>

<p>
Medina closed official relations with Salvador March
25th; and this act, being looked upon by Salvador
and Guatemala as a declaration of war, they invaded
Honduras, and soon after a victory over Medina's general,
Velez, occupied the principal towns, all of which
revolted against Medina, and a provisional government
was set up<a name='FA_XXII-14' id='FA_XXII-14' href='#FN_XXII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-14]</a> with Céleo Arias at the head of affairs.
Medina had temporarily placed the executive office
in charge of Crescencio Gomez, and taken command
of his troops in the field. Upon Comayagua being
occupied by the Salvadorans, Gomez and his officials
fled to Gracias. Medina attempted, May 27th, to
recapture Comayagua, but was repulsed.<a name='FA_XXII-15' id='FA_XXII-15' href='#FN_XXII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-15]</a>
</p>

<p>
Omoa had been given up July 20th to Juan Antonio
Medina, a Salvadoran general, for Arias' government.

with only six officers to Omoa,<a name='FA_XXII-16' id='FA_XXII-16' href='#FN_XXII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-16]</a> where he joined the
other man of the same surname, who had a few days
previously accepted the executive office, transferred
to him by Crescencio Gomez, proclaiming himself
provisional president, and appointing a cabinet. But
a revolt of the troops put an end to this arrangement,
José M. Medina, his substitute Gomez, and others
being made prisoners, and sent at once to Comayagua,
where they arrived on or about August 9th.<a name='FA_XXII-17' id='FA_XXII-17' href='#FN_XXII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-17]</a> Arias'
government now had but little difficulty to secure its

confinement to answer such charges as would be preferred
against him before the next national congress.<a name='FA_XXII-18' id='FA_XXII-18' href='#FN_XXII-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-18]</a>
A full amnesty was decreed for all political offences
committed from March 5, 1871, to November 1, 1872,
the only persons excluded from its benefits being José
María Medina, and his ministers, Manuel Colindres
and Rafael Padilla, who were also to abide the action
of congress.<a name='FA_XXII-19' id='FA_XXII-19' href='#FN_XXII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-19]</a>

<p>
The constitution of 1865 having become a dead letter,
the provisional government, in a decree of November
15th, recognized as existing in their full force all
the rights of citizens under republican institutions,<a name='FA_XXII-20' id='FA_XXII-20' href='#FN_XXII-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-20]</a>
though reserving the privilege of suspending some of
them in the event of public disturbance. This decree

COMING OF CONSERVATIVES.
</p>

<p>
Guatemala was experiencing troubles in her eastern
departments. An expedition of conservatives
landed at Trujillo from the ship <i>General Sherman</i>,
menacing the government of Arias, and at the same
time aiding the faction which was trying to overthrow
that of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XXII-23' id='FA_XXII-23' href='#FN_XXII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-23]</a> The latter and Salvador attributing
the scheme to President Guardia of Costa Rica,
jointly accredited a minister in Nicaragua, the result
of whose mission was a tripartite defensive alliance.
Arias decreed martial law, and reassumed the dictatorship
which the people conferred on him the previous
year.<a name='FA_XXII-24' id='FA_XXII-24' href='#FN_XXII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-24]</a>
</p>

<p>
The revolutionary forces under Miranda were signally
defeated by the Guatemalan commander, Solares,
on the north side of the Chamelecon River on the 9th
of August, with great loss, General Casto Alvarado
and Colonel A. Muñoz being killed, and a large quantity
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_460' name='Page_460' href='#Page_460'>460</a></span>
of war material falling into the victor's hands.<a name='FA_XXII-25' id='FA_XXII-25' href='#FN_XXII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-25]</a>
The presidents of Guatemala and Salvador, after the
insurrection in the former republic had been quelled,
held conferences at Chingo on the situation in Honduras,
and came to the conclusion that Arias' government,
being unpopular, could not sustain itself without
their material as well as moral support, which would
be a heavy burden. He was then asked in a joint
note to give up the executive office to some one more
in the confidence of the people. He refused to accede
to the demand, and the allied troops approached
Comayagua to carry out their suggestion. The first
notice of their intent was the proclamation in the town
of Aguanqueterique, of Ponciano Leiva as provisional
president, who organized his administration at Choluteca
on the 23d of November, and on the 8th of December
declared all the acts of Arias null.<a name='FA_XXII-26' id='FA_XXII-26' href='#FN_XXII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-26]</a>
</p>

<p>
The allied forces of Leiva under his minister of
war, General Juan Lopez, of Guatemala under Solares,
and of Salvador under Espinosa, laid siege to Comayagua
on the 6th of January, 1874, and after seven
days' resistance, Arias, together with his ministers and
chief supporters, had to capitulate on the 13th. Ex-president
Medina was released from confinement, and
eventually, having recognized the new ruler, was set
free, when he went to live in La Paz.<a name='FA_XXII-27' id='FA_XXII-27' href='#FN_XXII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-27]</a>

LEIVA SUCCEEDS ARIAS
</p>

<p>
Leiva's government was soon recognized by the
other states. It was of course expected to pursue a
policy in accord with the governments that gave it
existence. But it seems that Leiva preferred to follow
an independent course,<a name='FA_XXII-28' id='FA_XXII-28' href='#FN_XXII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-28]</a> and in a short time the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_461' name='Page_461' href='#Page_461'>461</a></span>
two powers that so elevated him were in antagonism,
Guatemala using her influence against and Salvador
for him, as will be seen hereafter. A constituent
congress convoked by Leiva adjourned in May, after
adopting three important measures; namely, confirming
Leiva as provisional president, restoring the constitution
of 1865, and ordering Arias into exile for
five years.<a name='FA_XXII-29' id='FA_XXII-29' href='#FN_XXII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-29]</a> The political state of affairs was not
satisfactory to Guatemala. The elections had yielded
a majority of conservatives and reactionists in congress,
and many if not most of the public offices had
gone into the hands of men of that party, one of the
most prominent being Manuel Colindres. The regular
congress was installed on the 20th of January,
1875, and the next day the executive sent in his message,
giving in detail the condition of public affairs.
February 1st he took the oath of office as constitutional
president, having been elected by the people.<a name='FA_XXII-30' id='FA_XXII-30' href='#FN_XXII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-30]</a>
A full amnesty for political offences was granted by
congress February 9th, and promulgated the same
day by the president and his minister of relations and
justice, Adolfo Zúñiga.
</p>

<p>
The people of Honduras were not allowed, however,
to enjoy the benefits of peace but for a short time;
for Ex-president Medina instigated, as it was generally
believed, by President Barrios of Guatemala, raised
at Gracias, on the 21st of December, the standard of
revolution, proclaiming himself provisional president.<a name='FA_XXII-31' id='FA_XXII-31' href='#FN_XXII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-31]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_462' name='Page_462' href='#Page_462'>462</a></span>
He afterward suffered for his lack of wisdom. The
government at once prepared to meet the emergency.
Salvador organized a force to support it, and Guatemala
resolved to sustain Medina, whose real plan was
to hurl Gonzalez from the executive chair of Salvador,
as well as Leiva from that of Honduras.
</p>

<p>
The revolution assumed proportions, and Medina
had come to believe himself master of the situation.
The presidents of Salvador and Guatemala arranged
at Chingo, on the 15th of February, 1876, to intervene
in Honduras and stop the revolution. At this time
it was thought that Leiva could not hold his own, his
forces having been routed at Intibucá, and his authority
being felt only in the eastern departments. The
rebels had captured the capital, Comayagua, and delivered
it to the horrors of an exterminating war.
But the battle of Naranjo changed the aspect of affairs,
Leiva's troops gaining there a decisive victory, which
restored his authority over almost the whole extent of
the republic.<a name='FA_XXII-32' id='FA_XXII-32' href='#FN_XXII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-32]</a> There was no further need of Guatemala
and Salvador pacifying Honduras; peace had
been virtually restored, and only a few scattered parties
of rebels in the departments of Copan and Gracias
had to be eliminated.<a name='FA_XXII-33' id='FA_XXII-33' href='#FN_XXII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-33]</a> But soon after another contestant
for the presidential office appeared on the
field, namely, Marco Aurelio Soto, ex-minister of foreign
relations of Guatemala,<a name='FA_XXII-34' id='FA_XXII-34' href='#FN_XXII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-34]</a> whom a Guatemalan
force supported. A treaty of peace was concluded,
however, with the mediation of Salvador, at Los Cedros
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_463' name='Page_463' href='#Page_463'>463</a></span>
June 8, 1876,<a name='FA_XXII-35' id='FA_XXII-35' href='#FN_XXII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-35]</a> and the executive office went into
the hands of Crescencio Gomez by transfer from Marcelino
Mejía, to whom the treaty had given it. Gomez
decreed August 12th to turn over the office to Medina,
who declined accepting it; but as the republic was
thereby left without a chief magistrate, he concluded
on the 18th to call Marco Aurelio Soto to fill the
position,<a name='FA_XXII-36' id='FA_XXII-36' href='#FN_XXII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-36]</a> denying in a manifesto that Guatemala purposed
controlling the affairs of Honduras.<a name='FA_XXII-37' id='FA_XXII-37' href='#FN_XXII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-37]</a>

PRESIDENT SOTO.

<p>
Soto announced August 27th from Amapala<a name='FA_XXII-38' id='FA_XXII-38' href='#FN_XXII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-38]</a> his
assumption of the executive duties, declaring that his
policy would be fair and friendly at home and toward
the other Central American states, and that he was
free from internal or foreign entanglements. He was
soon after recognized by other governments as the
legitimate chief magistrate of Honduras.<a name='FA_XXII-39' id='FA_XXII-39' href='#FN_XXII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-39]</a> Under his
administration the people were once more enabled to
devote themselves to peaceful pursuits. On the 27th
of May, 1877, in an extensive message to congress, he
set forth the condition of public affairs, and what his
government had done in every branch of the public
service during the last nine months. He assured the
representatives that no branch had been neglected;
and expressed the hope that if peace and order were
preserved, the country would erelong begin to reap
the benefits of his measures.<a name='FA_XXII-40' id='FA_XXII-40' href='#FN_XXII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-40]</a> He had been chosen
by the people, on April 22d, constitutional president,
and the extraordinary congress acknowledged him as

such on the 29th of May. He was formally inaugurated
on the following day.
</p>

<p>
Ex-president Medina, and the Salvadoran general
Ezequiel Marin, together with two colonels and several
other officers of less rank, and a number of civilians,
for an attempted rebellion in the latter end of
1877, were subjected to the action of a court-martial
at Santa Rosa, on the charge of high treason and
other offences,<a name='FA_XXII-41' id='FA_XXII-41' href='#FN_XXII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-41]</a> and sentenced to death. The cause
being taken, for revision, to the supreme council of
war, the sentence against Medina and Marin was confirmed,
the court having found no extenuating circumstances;
one lieutenant and one sergeant obtained
a commutation to ten years' confinement in the fortress
at Omoa. The other prisoners were set at liberty,
but with a warning never again to engage in similar
conspiracies, or the sentence of the court-martial
against them would be enforced. Medina and Marin
were shot at Santa Rosa at 8 o'clock in the morning
of February 8, 1878.<a name='FA_XXII-42' id='FA_XXII-42' href='#FN_XXII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-42]</a> The other two men were at
once despatched to their prison at Omoa.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">AN INFAMOUS RULER.</p>

<p class="p2">
José María Medina has been styled a genuine liberal,
and his friends gave him credit as a commander
of resources, and an able administrator. His military
record showed that he surrendered the fortress of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_465' name='Page_465' href='#Page_465'>465</a></span>
Omoa to General Carrera, and followed him to Guatemala,
where he was rewarded for that service with a
lieutenant-colonelcy. He never won any action of
importance. During the insurrection of Olancho in
1864, he never went beyond Yoro until informed that
the affair was over. He issued the order of December
25, 1864, countersigned by his minister, Francisco
Cruz, empowering all his officers to put prisoners to
death,<a name='FA_XXII-43' id='FA_XXII-43' href='#FN_XXII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-43]</a> and that in the face of several constitutional
clauses abolishing the death penalty, and forbidding
the trial of citizens by military courts. He was also
guilty of incendiarism in burning many towns and
haciendas, and of confiscation. He made himself and
his satellites wealthy at the expense of his country
and his victims. He reached the presidency by the
favor of the oligarchs of Guatemala. As a ruler he
was an unmitigated tyrant; as an administrator he
left nothing to entitle him to a place among the benefactors
of his nation—no schools, no material improvements
of any kind. In lieu thereof he left the
national name dishonored abroad, the national character
degraded, financial ruin, corruption, immorality,
poverty, bitter animosities, and almost every misfortune
that could have befallen hapless Honduras.
</p>

<p class="p2">
Nothing worthy of particular mention occurred
from this time on till November 2, 1880, when the
national capital was removed to Tegucigalpa. In
December of the same year Marco Aurelio Soto was
reëlected president,<a name='FA_XXII-44' id='FA_XXII-44' href='#FN_XXII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-44]</a> and the people continued enjoying
the benefits of peace. The national assembly met at
Tegucigalpa on the 19th of February, 1883. Doctor
Soto was again installed as president by virtue of a
reëlection, and in an able and lucid address congratulated
the representatives of the people that since their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_466' name='Page_466' href='#Page_466'>466</a></span>
last meeting in 1881 quiet had reigned, and the liberal
constitution framed in 1877 had worked successfully.
Relations with Costa Rica, interrupted in
1878, were renewed on the 15th of last October; and
those with the rest of the Central American states, as
well as with other powers, were on the most friendly
footing. The long-pending boundary question with
Salvador had been referred to the arbitration of President
Zavala of Nicaragua. The government had, on
the 15th of September, 1882, sanctioned the plan of
Central American unification. Finances were in a
satisfactory state, large payments having relieved the
treasury of heavy burdens. The administration of
justice had become improved, and public education
advanced. Agriculture was progressing, trade on the
increase with the facilities afforded it; and mining had
engaged the attention of capitalists both at home and
abroad.<a name='FA_XXII-45' id='FA_XXII-45' href='#FN_XXII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-45]</a>
</p>

<p>
President Soto sent in his resignation to congress
on March 10th, pleading ill health. It was not accepted,
and instead a leave of absence was granted
him with a liberal pecuniary allowance for expenses.<a name='FA_XXII-46' id='FA_XXII-46' href='#FN_XXII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-46]</a>
Congress thought proper, however, to utilize his intended
visit to Europe to place on a better footing the
financial affairs of the republic.<a name='FA_XXII-47' id='FA_XXII-47' href='#FN_XXII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-47]</a> Before taking his
departure, Soto placed, on the 9th of May, the executive
office in charge of the council of ministers, namely,
Enrique Gutierrez, Luis Bogran, and Rafael Alvarado.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_467' name='Page_467' href='#Page_467'>467</a></span>
This was in accordance with the constitution. In
bidding good by to his fellow-citizens, Soto congratulated
them upon the reign of peace at home,<a name='FA_XXII-48' id='FA_XXII-48' href='#FN_XXII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-48]</a> and the
cordiality existing with other nations. He promised
to come back as soon as possible to complete his term,
and to surrender the trust to his successor.<a name='FA_XXII-49' id='FA_XXII-49' href='#FN_XXII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-49]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SOTO AND BARRIOS.
</p>

<p>
A serious quarrel occurred soon after, while Soto
was in San Francisco, California, between him and
Barrios. He received, as he considered it, from a
reliable source, information that Barrios, being displeased
with his government, had resolved to promote
a revolution in Honduras as an excuse for war and
for overthrowing that government. He wrote Barrios
on July 6, 1883, that his government having been
ever loyal and friendly to and fulfilled its treaty obligations
with Guatemala, he must attribute to personal
motives Barrios' intended course. He was not, he
said, disposed to give the latter an opportunity to sow
distraction in his own country, and to let loose again
the dogs of war in all Central America. To avert
those calamities he was ready to bring about a legal
transfer of his office, and would lay his final resignation
before congress. But he wished Barrios to know
that he did so actuated by patriotic motives, and not
by fear, for he had sufficient power in Honduras to
sustain himself, and to defend her against unjust aggression.
Barrios returned a scathful answer on
August 3d. After denying Soto's accusations, he attributes
his resignation to a preconceived resolve to
desert by actual flight his post, and lead abroad a life
of ease and luxury upon his ill-gotten wealth; and
now was using his, Barrios', name as a pretext to
justify his conduct. He asserts that Soto left Honduras
with the intention of not returning, and indeed,
with a full knowledge that the Hondurans would never
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_468' name='Page_468' href='#Page_468'>468</a></span>
permit his return.<a name='FA_XXII-50' id='FA_XXII-50' href='#FN_XXII-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-50]</a> The writer in the plainest language
accuses him of having enriched himself at the
expense of a country which he had ruined, and of private
parties alike. As to Soto's brave words, they
are taken, he says, at their true worth in Guatemala,
where he is well known. It would be easier and less
costly to hurl him from power, than it was to raise
him to and keep him at the head of the government.
</p>

<p>
Barrios concluded that he would take no further
notice of Soto's remarks, as there was a broad sea between
them. His charges about Soto's incompetency,
disloyalty, and general dishonesty are certainly exaggerated.
Soto sent his resignation from San Francisco,
and congress unanimously accepted it on the 3d of
September.<a name='FA_XXII-51' id='FA_XXII-51' href='#FN_XXII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-51]</a>
</p>

<p>
General Luis Bogran was spontaneously and almost
by unanimity chosen by the people president of the
republic,<a name='FA_XXII-52' id='FA_XXII-52' href='#FN_XXII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-52]</a> and assumed the duties on the 30th of November,
soon after organizing his cabinet with the
ministers named below.<a name='FA_XXII-53' id='FA_XXII-53' href='#FN_XXII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-53]</a>
</p>

<p>
The country continued at peace, and there was no
reason to apprehend any immediate disturbance. In
the attempt made by Guatemala to reorganize Central
America by force of arms, in the early part of 1885,
Honduras pledged her coöperation, but had little opportunity
to take an active part. Upon hearing of
the Guatemalan defeat, and of the death of President
Barrios on the 2d of April, she wavered, but finally
made peace with Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica.

<p class="sidenote">
PEACE RESTORED.
</p>

<p>
About the middle of 1885 there were near Trujillo
some slight disturbances, but quiet was restored. A
filibustering expedition was expected at Trujillo on the
ship <i>Dorian</i>, said to have been fitted out by Ex-president
Soto, with the view of recovering power. The
government of Belize, at the request of the Honduran
authorities, despatched the gun-boat <i>Lily</i> to Trujillo,
where she arrived September 29th, and made known
the object of her visit.<a name='FA_XXII-54' id='FA_XXII-54' href='#FN_XXII-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXII-54]</a> No such expedition came to
create disturbance. Still later, in 1886, a similar attempt
was made but failed, the ship supposed to have
been engaged for the purpose being captured at sea
by an American cruiser.

The administration of President Fernando Guzman
entered upon its duties on the 1st of March, 1867,
under good auspices. Peace reigned, the country was
prosperous, and the public treasury equally so.<a name='FA_XXIII-1' id='FA_XXIII-1' href='#FN_XXIII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-1]</a> This
was the first time that the government could lay so

himself to use his best endeavors to consolidate republican

conciliatory policy, and this was received with joy
throughout the land, a policy which was initiated on
the same day of his inauguration with an amnesty to
all citizens undergoing prosecution or punishment for
political offences. Those in exile were invited to
return to their homes; among them was Máximo
Jerez, who had been sojourning in Costa Rica, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_471' name='Page_471' href='#Page_471'>471</a></span>
accepted the pardon. The bishop of the diocese was
apprised of the president's desire for continued harmony
between the civil and ecclesiastical jurisdictions,
which was responded to in the same spirit by the prelate.
There was then every prospect of a long peace.
At the opening of the congressional session, January
25, 1869, the president made a cheering report, and it
was believed that the course of the government was
generally well received; but when it was proposed in
congress to vote an approval of it, some remarks were
made in the senate which the president was displeased
at, and he tendered his resignation of the executive
office on the 19th of March.<a name='FA_XXIII-3' id='FA_XXIII-3' href='#FN_XXIII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-3]</a> Congress unanimously
refused to accept it. The session lasted fifty-seven
days, coming to an end March 22d, and in the course
of it several laws were enacted to benefit agriculture
and commerce; but on the other hand, congress was
accused of having too lavishly voted pensions to military
men.

REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT.
</p>

<p>
The public peace was disturbed by a revolutionary
movement June 26th, when a party of men calling
themselves liberals assaulted and captured the barracks
at Leon. The chief leaders of this revolution
were Máximo Jerez, Ex-president Martinez,<a name='FA_XXIII-4' id='FA_XXIII-4' href='#FN_XXIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-4]</a> Hilario
Oliva, and Pascasio Bermudez.<a name='FA_XXIII-5' id='FA_XXIII-5' href='#FN_XXIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-5]</a> On the following
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_472' name='Page_472' href='#Page_472'>472</a></span>

the existing authorities, and implant the liberal principles
set forth in the plan accompanying his proclamation
of the same date.<a name='FA_XXIII-6' id='FA_XXIII-6' href='#FN_XXIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-6]</a> The next step was to levy a
contribution of $62,000 in Leon, and then to occupy
the port of Realejo. Jerez installed the government
on the 29th with Buenaventura Selva as minister-general,
but on the same day transferred the supreme
authority to Francisco Baca, retaining himself the
chief command of the forces.<a name='FA_XXIII-7' id='FA_XXIII-7' href='#FN_XXIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-7]</a>

The government at Managua adopted stringent

Commissioners from Honduras, Salvador, and Costa

of the differences, but their efforts proved
unavailing,<a name='FA_XXIII-12' id='FA_XXIII-12' href='#FN_XXIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-12]</a> and the forces of the opposing governments
soon came to blows. The insurgents obtained
some advantage in the unsuccessful attacks made in

July, by General Urtecho.<a name='FA_XXIII-13' id='FA_XXIII-13' href='#FN_XXIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-13]</a> They claimed to have

<p>
President Guzman took command of the forces in
the field,<a name='FA_XXIII-15' id='FA_XXIII-15' href='#FN_XXIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-15]</a> leaving the executive office temporarily in
charge of Senator Pedro Joaquin Chamorro. The
insurgents took Jinotepe, and about the middle of
September were concentrated in Masatepe, surrounded
from north to south by the well-fortified and garrisoned
towns of Managua, Granada, Rivas, and Nandaimé.
An attempt made by them October 13th against Matagalpa
proved disastrous, and they had to retreat to
Leon. On the 14th they were utterly undone by
Guzman at Niquinohomo. Their force, 1,500 strong,
attacked Guzman at a little past one o'clock, and was
repulsed with heavy losses. The next morning Guzman
went in pursuit, and on approaching Jinotepe
the enemy dispersed in all directions, abandoning
the western department.<a name='FA_XXIII-16' id='FA_XXIII-16' href='#FN_XXIII-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-16]</a> Guzman reached Pueblo
Nuevo on the 21st, and sent a proclamation on the

the men who had so unreasonably caused the desolation
and misery of the past four months.<a name='FA_XXIII-17' id='FA_XXIII-17' href='#FN_XXIII-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-17]</a> However,

The acting president, on the 29th of October, gave
Guzman a vote of thanks for his services, and conferred
on him the rank of general of division. After a short
visit by the government and Guzman to Granada, and
peace being fully restored, Guzman resumed at that
place the presidential office on November 25th.<a name='FA_XXIII-19' id='FA_XXIII-19' href='#FN_XXIII-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-19]</a> On
the 17th of December he decreed the reëstablishment

Nothing worthy of particular notice occurred this
year, except the election of president for the next

with the requisite majority of votes. He took
possession of the office on the 1st of March, 1871.<a name='FA_XXIII-21' id='FA_XXIII-21' href='#FN_XXIII-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-21]</a>
Congress being about to close its session, the executive
in a special message, March 30th, called its attention
to important affairs demanding prompt measures. The
treasury was exhausted, and the government needed
resources to meet its obligations. It also should be
clothed with powers and means to face the complications
that might arise from the disturbed relations of
Salvador with Honduras. But congress suspended
the session for twenty days, though not without having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_476' name='Page_476' href='#Page_476'>476</a></span>
first authorized the president to raise loans for
covering the more pressing needs of the treasury, and
empowered him to act as he might think best on behalf
of the honor and interests of the country during
the recess.<a name='FA_XXIII-22' id='FA_XXIII-22' href='#FN_XXIII-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-22]</a> In the war between the above-named
states, Nicaragua maintained the strictest neutrality,
and had the good fortune to escape being mixed up in
that trouble.
</p>

<p>
The country being at peace, both at home and
abroad, the government was enabled to devote its
whole attention to the finances, which were in an unsatisfactory
state, owing to a marked decrease of the
revenues in the two last fiscal years.<a name='FA_XXIII-23' id='FA_XXIII-23' href='#FN_XXIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-23]</a> The general
situation, if not good, was nevertheless far from discouraging.
But a new element was now ushered in,
which was destined to become erelong an agent of
disturbance. I refer to the coming of seventy members
of the society of Jesus, who on their expulsion
from Guatemala landed unopposed at Realejo, and
journeyed to Leon, where a portion of the inhabitants
gave them a warm reception. Discussions ensued;
some were in favor of giving the new-comers convents,
turning over to them public education, and allowing
them every privilege as they had had at their late
field; others demanded that they should be sent away.
The government took no action, other than permitting
them to remain, and they soon ingratiated themselves
with the masses.<a name='FA_XXIII-24' id='FA_XXIII-24' href='#FN_XXIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-24]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
PARTIES AND PRINCIPLES.
</p>

<p>
Toward the end of the year rumors of an impending
revolution were rife. There was no cause for it.
Quadra's administration certainly was deserving of
public support.<a name='FA_XXIII-25' id='FA_XXIII-25' href='#FN_XXIII-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-25]</a> But it seemed the fashion of Nicaragua
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_477' name='Page_477' href='#Page_477'>477</a></span>
either to be on the eve of or in the throes of
revolution, or at least to talk of one.<a name='FA_XXIII-26' id='FA_XXIII-26' href='#FN_XXIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-26]</a> At the present
time there were three political parties, and a club aspiring
to that rank. The party in power was called by
some of its members liberal conservador, and by others
republicano. This party had a large following of well-to-do
and sedate citizens. It had no monarchical, aristocratic,
or theocratic tendencies; on the contrary, its
principles were liberal and progressive, but it moved
slowly, from fear of disturbing peace and order.
Another party was formed, of men who at one time
used to call themselves democrats, but had lately taken
a conservative for a leader, become associated with
the clergy, and adopted the name of moderado. The
third party, hardly entitled to the rank, was made up
of young men anxious for the greatest development of
liberty and progress. Its members were scattered, or
affiliated with other parties. Then there was the club,
composed of a few hot-heads who insisted on being
the mountain, and parodying the French Jacobins of
1793. The fears of revolution were on the increase
in the first part of 1872. The self-styled moderados
of the five states were working together in Leon, the
native clergy and the jesuits being the common centre
of the revolutionary propaganda, and the government
of President Medina of Honduras encouraging
them.
</p>

<p>
The congressional elections took place in October
with much agitation and disturbance in several localities.<a name='FA_XXIII-27' id='FA_XXIII-27' href='#FN_XXIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-27]</a>
There was considerable independence exhibited
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_478' name='Page_478' href='#Page_478'>478</a></span>
by the voters. The liberal conservatives obtained a
working majority, and high hopes were entertained
from the congress which was to sit on the 1st of January,
1873.
</p>

<p>
The year 1872 was a happy one for Nicaragua.
Not only was peace consolidated, but party animosity
greatly decreased. Trade and agriculture yielded
good results; the public administration was much
improved; the treasury also felt easy, and public credit
was restored. Congress assembled on the appointed
day, and the president's message contained an encouraging
report. He said that the rights of citizens
had been respected, and an asylum allowed to the
refugees of other states, including the jesuits.<a name='FA_XXIII-28' id='FA_XXIII-28' href='#FN_XXIII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-28]</a> He
labored to impress upon the representatives the necessity
of providing means to increase the revenue; but
nothing had been done at the end of February, and
the president saw, besides, that notwithstanding his
moderate, impartial, and conciliatory policy, a considerable
portion of the citizens refused to lend him their
coöperation. In view of all this, and of his advanced
age and ill health, he tendered his resignation on the
1st of March, setting forth the reasons for his doing
so; but the chambers refused to accept it.<a name='FA_XXIII-29' id='FA_XXIII-29' href='#FN_XXIII-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-29]</a> Congress
adjourned on the 20th of March to continue its labors
in 1874. Several important laws had been passed, for
which the legislature deserved credit. On the other
hand, it was blamed for a lavish bestowal of pensions,
and for an excessive number of pardons and other
favors to criminals. The jesuit question was resolved
February 12th in favor of permitting the priests to
remain.<a name='FA_XXIII-30' id='FA_XXIII-30' href='#FN_XXIII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-30]</a>

<p>
The relations with Costa Rica were most unsatisfactory,
and the government took action to meet any
possible emergency. Pursuant to its decree of August
28th, congress assembled September 16th, when
President Quadra's message made known that events
had taken place calling for an abandonment of the
policy he had hitherto pursued of absolute abstention
from interference in the affairs of the other Central
American states.<a name='FA_XXIII-31' id='FA_XXIII-31' href='#FN_XXIII-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-31]</a> His administration reported the
intrigues of President Guardia of Costa Rica with
discontented Nicaraguans for its overthrow. It was
generally believed that a disturbance of the public
peace was impending, and that Costa Rican money had
circulated among the men concerned in the plot.<a name='FA_XXIII-32' id='FA_XXIII-32' href='#FN_XXIII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-32]</a>
These men, some of whom were officers in the service
of Nicaragua, concealed themselves, and a number of
them went to Costa Rica to tender their services to
the enemy of their country. Meantime a body of
armed men raised by the reactionary party of Central
America made its appearance in Honduras, which
alarmed the governments of Guatemala and Salvador.
These powers represented to Nicaragua the movements
to be unquestionably the work of Costa Rica,
proposing an alliance against the latter.<a name='FA_XXIII-33' id='FA_XXIII-33' href='#FN_XXIII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-33]</a> A defensive
alliance was concluded on the 26th of August, the
plenipotentiaries being Anselmo H. Rivas and B. Carazo.
This treaty was approved by the three governments.<a name='FA_XXIII-34' id='FA_XXIII-34' href='#FN_XXIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-34]</a>
It contained, besides, two other clauses;
namely, the allied powers were to endeavor to bring
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_480' name='Page_480' href='#Page_480'>480</a></span>

Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and coöperate toward the
reorganization of Central America under a single government.<a name='FA_XXIII-35' id='FA_XXIII-35' href='#FN_XXIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-35]</a>
</p>

<p>
Congress closed the session on the 15th of October,
and shortly after the government was apprised of the
departure from Puntarenas, Costa Rica, on the vessel
named <i>Tigre</i>, of an expedition of Nicaraguans under
Tinoco bound to Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XXIII-36' id='FA_XXIII-36' href='#FN_XXIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-36]</a> The expedition landed on
the 3d of November, not in Nicaraguan territory, but
in San Bernardo, a small port of Honduras. Nicaragua
at once sent a force to the frontier, and Minister
Delgadillo started for Honduras to obtain permission
from the government to pursue the invaders within
her limits, which being granted, the Nicaraguans
marched from Somotillo into Honduras, and acting
in accord with another force from Salvador, the invaders
abandoned Corpus, and repaired to Tegucigalpa,
where Tinoco capitulated.<a name='FA_XXIII-37' id='FA_XXIII-37' href='#FN_XXIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-37]</a> The Nicaraguan

on the 1st of March, 1875.<a name='FA_XXIII-41' id='FA_XXIII-41' href='#FN_XXIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-41]</a> Quadra returned with
alacrity to private life. The new administration soon
had to deal with seditious attempts which had been
prepared during Quadra's rule. One of Chamorro's
first acts was to issue an unconditional pardon to the
parties implicated, hoping that it would bring the government's
opponents to a better feeling. But the result
was quite different; for they began a series of
plots, and it then became necessary to issue, on the
17th of November, 1875, a decree of expulsion and of
partial banishments. This quieted the country, and
peace would have become consolidated but for the
opportunities afforded the agitators in the neighboring
states to start another conflagration. Costa Rica became
the asylum of the discontented of Nicaragua,
who took advantage of the interrupted relations between
the two governments to promote a war that
might give them the control of affairs in their country.
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica suspended diplomatic and commercial
relations with Nicaragua; but the latter concluded not
to decree a suspension of trade, with the view of not
injuring innocent persons. No actual war existed,
but it might break out at any moment, in view of
Costa Rica's menacing attitude.<a name='FA_XXIII-42' id='FA_XXIII-42' href='#FN_XXIII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-42]</a> At last the government
found itself threatened from various quarters.

to which they responded with enthusiasm.<a name='FA_XXIII-43' id='FA_XXIII-43' href='#FN_XXIII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-43]</a>
Martial law was proclaimed, and the president assumed
personal command of the forces, the executive office
being temporarily placed in charge of Senator Pedro
Balladares. When the danger of war had passed, the
decree of martial law was repealed.<a name='FA_XXIII-44' id='FA_XXIII-44' href='#FN_XXIII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-44]</a> Elections for

<p>
Peace reigned during the last two years of Chamorro's
rule, which enabled him to devote his attention
to the advancement of the country's interests. Notwithstanding
the past difficulties, the national finances
had attained a better organization, and the national
credit was on a higher plane. The people showed a
growing disposition to employ themselves in the arts
of peace, their civil and political rights being fully
respected by the authorities. Friendly relations existed
with foreign powers, and no complications were
apprehended with the neighbors.<a name='FA_XXIII-46' id='FA_XXIII-46' href='#FN_XXIII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-46]</a> The elections for

JESUIT DISTURBANCES.
</p>

<p>
The apprehensions felt by a large number of citizens
of serious troubles from the presence of the jesuits
were realized in May 1881. On the 6th there was an
Indian insurrection in Matagalpa, accompanied with
considerable bloodshed, and the jesuits were said to be
the instigators.<a name='FA_XXIII-53' id='FA_XXIII-53' href='#FN_XXIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-53]</a> Twenty members of the order residing
in that place were arrested and taken under guard
to Granada. A still more alarming revolt took place
in Leon. At the opening of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Instituto de Occidente</span>,
an educational establishment under the special
protection of the national authorities, Professor J.
Leonard, from Spain, made certain remarks, at which
the jesuit fathers took umbrage.<a name='FA_XXIII-54' id='FA_XXIII-54' href='#FN_XXIII-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-54]</a> They, together
with a certain Apolonio Orozco, accused Leonard and
Calderon of being free-thinkers and assailants of religion.
The forty or fifty fathers living in Leon took
the matter in hand energetically, and in two days
there was hardly a person in the place who had not
been told that the religion of their fathers was imperilled
by the propaganda of the free-thinkers of the
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">instituto</span>. Relying on the support of a fanatical rabble,
they assumed a bold attitude, and demanded prompt
action on the part of Bishop Ulloa y Larios. But the
latter would not uphold them. This greatly exasperated
them. Meantime the rabble became seditious.
Parties of armed men intrenched themselves in the
old Recoleccion convent, and laboring under the excitement
produced by the speeches of their leaders and
the free use of rum, they resisted the troops engaged
in an effort to preserve order, eight or ten being killed,
and many more wounded. The mob retreated to the
Recoleccion, resolved to continue the fight, defying
the local authorities, who, in fact, did not show much
disposition to put them down, the prefect being a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_485' name='Page_485' href='#Page_485'>485</a></span>
friend of the jesuits. The commander of the forces
was an aged soldier, who could not do much active
service. However, he captured the two chief leaders,
Bermudez and Duvon, and sent them to Managua,
where they were imprisoned. The supreme government
adopted prompt measures, despatched troops to
Leon, who brought the rebels under subjection, and
then expelled the jesuits from the country.<a name='FA_XXIII-55' id='FA_XXIII-55' href='#FN_XXIII-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-55]</a> It was
believed that the real object of those movements was
to overthrow Zavala and place Pedro Balladares in
the executive chair. The question for a time seemed
to be who should rule—the government or the jesuits.
Zavala's energy settled it.
</p>

<p>
In July 1882 there was a slight rebellion in Gracias
á Dios, and later disturbances in Matagalpa, Telica,
and Subtiaba; but though causing some expense,
because the government had to station a strong force
there during a considerable time, public works were
not thereby interrupted. The president, in his message
to congress at the inception of 1883, expressed
himself as gratified with the report he had to make,
and retained the most perfect confidence in the future
progress and prosperity of the republic. His successor,
Adan Cárdenas,<a name='FA_XXIII-56' id='FA_XXIII-56' href='#FN_XXIII-56' class='fnanchor'>[XXIII-56]</a> elected by popular suffrage,
was placed in possession of the office on the 1st of

in the later political partition Panamá is not classed
among the Central American states.
</p>

<p class="p2">
We have seen in a preceding volume how Panamá,
formerly the entrepôt for the trade of Spain with her
South American colonies on the Pacific, in the course
of the eighteenth century descended from her lofty
position, and became veiled in obscurity, until the
name of the once famous Castilla del Oro is well-nigh
consigned to the pages of modern mythology.
The events of the following century, which so beneficially
changed the political condition of most of the
American provinces, only tended to impoverish the
Isthmus. However, its important geographical position,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_489' name='Page_489' href='#Page_489'>489</a></span>
making it a bridge between the two great oceans,
brought back for a time the old prosperity, notably by
reason of the discovery of gold in California, the building
of a railway, and the much-discussed project of an
interoceanic ship canal.

UNDER THE VICEROYS.
</p>

<p>
The Isthmus was enjoying in 1801 its usual tranquillity
under the rule of the Spanish viceroy at Santa
Fé de Bogotá, Pedro de Mendinueta y Muzquiz, as
well as under the more immediate one of Brigadier
Antonio Narvaez y la Torre, the governor and comandante
general. He was in 1803 promoted to mariscal
de campo, and relieved on the 15th of March the
same year, by Colonel Juan de Márcos Urbina, who at
his death in 1805 was succeeded<a name='FA_XXIV-1' id='FA_XXIV-1' href='#FN_XXIV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-1]</a> by Brigadier Juan
A. de la Mata. The latter is represented to have been
a man of estimable character, and as he was both respected
and liked, he found during his term but little
difficulty to rule the three provinces of Portobello,
Veragua, and Darien, and the partidos of Natá and
Alange, into which this region had been divided.<a name='FA_XXIV-2' id='FA_XXIV-2' href='#FN_XXIV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-2]</a>
Pursuant to the customary policy of Spain, an <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">asesor</span>,
or legal adviser, was appointed to consult with him,
while the military functions of the governor, in case
of his being prevented, were assumed by another substitute,
also nominated beforehand, with the title of
teniente de rey.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_490' name='Page_490' href='#Page_490'>490</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The judicial organization was equal to those of other
Spanish colonies; matters of little importance were
decided by the ordinary alcaldes or the city councils,
and only appeals were brought before the courts of
Bogotá.<a name='FA_XXIV-3' id='FA_XXIV-3' href='#FN_XXIV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-3]</a> There was also an extensive financial department,
comprising the custom-houses of Portobello,
Chagres, and Panamá, a general treasury with
its dependent offices and the different administrations
of customs and monopolies belonging to the crown.
But their product was not sufficient to cover the expenses
of the provinces, with their numerous officials
and a permanent military force,<a name='FA_XXIV-4' id='FA_XXIV-4' href='#FN_XXIV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-4]</a> required as garrisons
for Portobello, Chagres, and Panamá, all of which
places were then fortified, and temporarily financial
subventions from Peru became necessary. The reason
was the decline of commerce which involved a corresponding
neglect of husbandry, and other branches,
agriculture producing only what was required for
home consumption. Stock-raising, for which the soil
of Veragua was so well adapted, decreased; and mining
in Portobello and Darien was scarcely worthy of
mention. Such a depressing state of affairs could but
have a degenerating influence on the inhabitants,
which, if not fostered by the government, at least was
allowed to go on without an effort to check it. Education
was at a low ebb everywhere; in the capital
there was one primary school and a Latin class.
Nearly all books not of a certain religious character<a name='FA_XXIV-5' id='FA_XXIV-5' href='#FN_XXIV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-5]</a>
were forbidden, intercourse with foreigners was hindered,
and the diffusion of liberal ideas was effectually
repressed. The facility of obtaining the few means of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_491' name='Page_491' href='#Page_491'>491</a></span>
subsistence required in such a climate contributed to
produce that state of indolence which characterized
the inhabitants at the beginning of the nineteenth
century. Most of their time was spent in bull-fights,
gambling, and religious performances, there being more
than one hundred holidays in the year. The regular
clergy, as in other parts of Spanish America, had always
been powerful in Panamá, and possessed, notwithstanding
the decadence of the country, a number
of establishments independent from those belonging
to the bishopric.<a name='FA_XXIV-6' id='FA_XXIV-6' href='#FN_XXIV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-6]</a>

HAPPY DAYS.
</p>

<p>
Thus all was lethargy in Panamá while the new
viceroy of New Granada, Antonio Amar y Borbon,
quietly assumed the government at Bogotá. Few of
the inhabitants of the Isthmus had a clear understanding
of the political convulsions that had taken place
in France and in the United States. The masses
were totally indifferent to and suffered little from the
policy of the government, which carefully suppressed
all information about the countries where anti-monarchical
principles prevailed. The course pursued
by the crown in this respect was as fruitless as was
another effort made at the time to revive trade by
reëstablishing on January 20, 1803, the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">casa de contratacion
de Indias</span>. The hope of Panamá again becoming
the great entrepôt for all ports on the Pacific
was not realized. Not a single vessel came from
Spain during the year; and open trade with foreign
countries being unlawful, smuggling was resorted to
by the merchants of Panamá and Jamaica, their
rendezvous being generally in the neighborhood of
Chagres, where English vessels transferred their cargoes
to small boats, which took the goods on shore.<a name='FA_XXIV-7' id='FA_XXIV-7' href='#FN_XXIV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_492' name='Page_492' href='#Page_492'>492</a></span>
This trade was continued, even in 1804, after Spain
had declared war against England, an event which
otherwise caused much excitement on the Isthmus.
But the people, instead of preparing for defence, contented
themselves with invoking the Lord of hosts
for favor to the Spanish arms, and for relief of their
own distress, or in other words, their laziness.<a name='FA_XXIV-8' id='FA_XXIV-8' href='#FN_XXIV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
The government and priesthood, acting in accord,
thus kept most of the population under control; and
it was only in 1808 that liberal ideas began to have
expression in the province, and this was due altogether
to foreign influence. The government of the mother
country, having declared the American possessions to
be no longer colonies, but integral parts of the monarchy,
their people having the same rights as the
people of Spain<a name='FA_XXIV-9' id='FA_XXIV-9' href='#FN_XXIV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-9]</a>—although the declaration of the
córtes to this effect was not generally known or appreciated,
to the intelligent, its significance was fully
understood. The movements for independence made in
other provinces could no longer be concealed from the
people, and the idea rapidly gained ground that Spanish
domination of America was approaching its end.
This greatly exacerbated the ill feeling always existing,
though only to a limited extent on the Isthmus,
between the Spaniards and the native Panameños.<a name='FA_XXIV-10' id='FA_XXIV-10' href='#FN_XXIV-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-10]</a>
</p>

<p>
In connection with it, a system of espionage was
established by the rulers, the discussion of politics
was discountenanced, and the holding of meetings forbidden.
But this policy was without effect; the liberty
to trade with Jamaica, granted in 1809 with a
view to appease the discontent of the Isthmians, invigorated
not only their commercial but also their
political life.<a name='FA_XXIV-11' id='FA_XXIV-11' href='#FN_XXIV-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-11]</a> Newspapers from Jamaica were occasionally
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_493' name='Page_493' href='#Page_493'>493</a></span>
received, and the contract with an enlightened
people gave rise to new ideas.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
REVOLUTIONARY WAR.
</p>

<p>
In New Granada the first resistance occurred at
Cartagena, where the governor, Francisco Montes,
opposed the establishment of a diputacion provincial,
and assumed an attitude hostile to the liberal cabildo.
He made his report to the viceroy, but before any redress
could be made he was arrested on June 14,
1810, and sent away to Habana.<a name='FA_XXIV-12' id='FA_XXIV-12' href='#FN_XXIV-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-12]</a> Hardly one
month later a similar movement broke out at Bogotá,
where several previous plans to overthrow the
viceregal authority had failed;<a name='FA_XXIV-13' id='FA_XXIV-13' href='#FN_XXIV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-13]</a> but the agitation being
continued, on the 20th of July a trifling incident<a name='FA_XXIV-14' id='FA_XXIV-14' href='#FN_XXIV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-14]</a>
sufficed to cause an outbreak. Three days later the
viceroy was imprisoned and the government placed in
charge of a junta.<a name='FA_XXIV-15' id='FA_XXIV-15' href='#FN_XXIV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-15]</a> The revolutionary movement in
Bogotá as in Cartagena did not at the time purpose
to break wholly with Spain; its real object was to
obtain an autonomic government without ignoring the
supremacy of that of the mother country.<a name='FA_XXIV-16' id='FA_XXIV-16' href='#FN_XXIV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-16]</a> It was
with such intent that both juntas extended invitations
to all the provinces of New Granada to meet in congress
and discuss the form of government to be
adopted. The governor of Panamá declined to take
part, and endeavored to persuade the people of the
Isthmus that there was no need for such a revolution.<a name='FA_XXIV-17' id='FA_XXIV-17' href='#FN_XXIV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-17]</a>
That the absence of the Panameños from the
congress, which met early in 1811, had not been of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_494' name='Page_494' href='#Page_494'>494</a></span>
their own choice, was not a secret to that body; and
when the fundamental act of the federation was passed,
it contained a clause binding all those represented in
the congress to labor for the freedom of the other
provinces which were still under Spanish control.<a name='FA_XXIV-18' id='FA_XXIV-18' href='#FN_XXIV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-18]</a>
</p>

<p>
It seemed, however, as if Panamá was more distant
than ever from gaining her independence. Early in
1812 a new viceroy, Benito Perez, arrived, and being
unable to get to Bogotá, established his residence on
the Isthmus,<a name='FA_XXIV-19' id='FA_XXIV-19' href='#FN_XXIV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-19]</a> where the audiencia and other offices
were also established. Thus Panamá became temporarily
the capital of New Granada, an honor little
cherished at that time by the friends of independence.
Perceiving the unsafe condition of the government,
the new viceroy took steps to increase his military
force. Upon his request, three men-of-war were sent
from Cuba and a battalion of soldiers from Spain,
part of which reënforcements were despatched to Santa
Marta, then at war with Cartagena. The latter place
was blockaded, and being hard pressed for supplies,
the insurgents despatched two commissioners with the
avowed object of treating with the viceroy for an armistice.
The project was favored by the vice-admiral
of the English squadron at Jamaica, Charles Sterling,
who guaranteed the commissioners a safe return.
They arrived at Panamá in October 1812, and at once
began pretended negotiations, their real purpose being
to gain time for the besieged town, obtain if possible
a suspension of hostilities, and ascertain the feeling of
the population. But some correspondence intercepted
by the governor of Santa Marta,<a name='FA_XXIV-20' id='FA_XXIV-20' href='#FN_XXIV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-20]</a> and forwarded
to Viceroy Perez, apprised the latter, who at once had
the commissioners arrested and brought to trial. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_495' name='Page_495' href='#Page_495'>495</a></span>
would have been severely dealt with but for the timely
interference of Sterling, who energetically demanded
their release, which the viceroy at last acceded to,
returning them to Cartagena. They had meantime
become satisfied that the intelligent part of the population
strongly favored the emancipation, and that the
new governor, Cárlos Meyner,<a name='FA_XXIV-21' id='FA_XXIV-21' href='#FN_XXIV-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-21]</a> could not prevent
any effort for independence. The only opposition to
be feared would be from the viceroy and the chief
officers of the garrison, most of whom were loyal and
energetic. But fortune seemed to smile on the revolutionary
party; several vessels with troops and military
supplies despatched by Perez to the relief of
Santa Marta, then besieged by the insurgents, fell
into the hands of the latter, and the viceroy himself
was removed from his position by the government in
Spain.<a name='FA_XXIV-22' id='FA_XXIV-22' href='#FN_XXIV-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-22]</a> His successor was the mariscal de campo,
Francisco Montalvo, who with some reënforcements
furnished by the government of Cuba proceeded from
Habana directly to Santa Marta, where he arrived in
May 1813, and forthwith began to push the military
operations against the revolutionists of Cartagena.

<p class="sidenote">
THE VICEREGAL PARTY.
</p>

<p>
The natives of Panamá rejoiced on hearing of the
establishment of the viceregal seat at Santa Marta,
and for obvious reasons. The danger was removed
that Panamá might become the theatre of a bloody
war, and on the other hand, there would be less difficulty
in working for the emancipation of the province.
The cause of independence gained more and more
sympathy; and when toward the close of 1813 it was
proposed to form a confederation, comprising New
Granada, Quito, Venezuela, and Tierra Firme, the
idea was eagerly embraced by the patriotic party on
the Isthmus. The friends of independence gradually
became bolder; they openly manifested their dislike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_496' name='Page_496' href='#Page_496'>496</a></span>
of Spanish rule at parties and in public songs, and
induced the cabildo to demand and obtain from the
government at Cádiz the removal of the bishop,<a name='FA_XXIV-23' id='FA_XXIV-23' href='#FN_XXIV-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-23]</a> and
the transfer of the officials of the audiencia, then in
Panamá, to other places. But the latter met with
opposition from the senior oidor, Joaquin Carrion, who
well understood the workings of the patriotic party,
and disregarding the protestations of the city council,
continued alone to exercise the jurisdiction of the
audiencia till 1816. Strange though it may appear,
and perhaps owing to the listlessness Panamá had
thus far exhibited, when revolution prevailed everywhere
else, the city came to be looked upon by the
government in Spain as most loyal; whereupon the
córtes resolved to reward it, establishing there a diputacion
provincial,<a name='FA_XXIV-24' id='FA_XXIV-24' href='#FN_XXIV-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-24]</a> which did not then come to pass,
for only one month later King Fernando suppressed
all such bodies, together with the constitution of
1812.<a name='FA_XXIV-25' id='FA_XXIV-25' href='#FN_XXIV-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-25]</a>
</p>

<p>
Unwilling to relinquish her hold on the American
colonies, Spain, early in 1815, fitted out an expedition
comprising sixty-five large and several smaller transport
vessels, convoyed by the line-of-battle ship <i>San
Pedro Alcantara</i> of seventy-four guns and several frigates;
the total number of sailors, soldiers, and marines
being 15,000,<a name='FA_XXIV-26' id='FA_XXIV-26' href='#FN_XXIV-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-26]</a> all well provided with artillery and
supplies, the soldiers being veterans of the war against
Napoleon's army.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
GOVERNOR HORE.
</p>

<p>
The original plan had been to send both fleet and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_497' name='Page_497' href='#Page_497'>497</a></span>
army to Montevideo, but subsequently it was considered
more urgent to regain possession of Venezuela
and New Granada, and to strengthen the forces on
the Isthmus.<a name='FA_XXIV-27' id='FA_XXIV-27' href='#FN_XXIV-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-27]</a> The general-in-chief was Mariscal de
campo Pablo Morillo, a brave man of firm character,
who, in nine years, had risen from sergeant to general.
Soon afterward more forces were sent out from
Spain to coöperate with those of Morillo, after which
they were to be stationed at Panamá. Their commander,
Alejandro de Hore, was appointed governor.
Military supplies were also sent to equip troops for a
campaign in Peru. The expectations of the Isthmians
were now almost beyond the possibility of realization.
It made but little difference that a part of
Hore's force fell into the hands of the insurgents of
Cartagena,<a name='FA_XXIV-28' id='FA_XXIV-28' href='#FN_XXIV-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-28]</a> and that Hore himself barely escaped
with the auxiliaries that Morillo could furnish almost
at any time; he was always able to maintain the Spanish
régime on the Isthmus. No sooner, indeed, had he
arrived at Panamá and established the government
on a military basis,<a name='FA_XXIV-29' id='FA_XXIV-29' href='#FN_XXIV-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-29]</a> than he displayed his harsh, despotic
character.<a name='FA_XXIV-30' id='FA_XXIV-30' href='#FN_XXIV-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-30]</a> An extensive system of espionage
was organized, and it is said that Hore treated the
members of the patriotic party "according to their
proclivities for independence, always availing himself
of some false pretext to strike." Much as the Isthmians
suffered under his iron rule, their anxiety became
greater when it was said that Morillo was on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_498' name='Page_498' href='#Page_498'>498</a></span>
his way to Panamá to place the city in a state of
defence; fortunately it proved to be a false alarm.
</p>

<p>
Hore was a partisan of absolute authority; but
when it suited his purposes he would support liberal
ideas and policies. Thus we see him coöperating
with the people of Panamá in opposing the reinstatement
of the jesuits.<a name='FA_XXIV-31' id='FA_XXIV-31' href='#FN_XXIV-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-31]</a> He did not like priestly interference
in state affairs. The governor also manifested
a strong inclination to foster trade with foreigners,
and it is said that he never refused to honor, with his
acceptance, such gifts as the smugglers awarded him.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ENGLISH EXPEDITION.
</p>

<p>
Early in 1819, news arrived that a formidable expedition
had been prepared in England by friends of
the insurgent cause, and was on its way to America,
intended to wrest the Isthmus from Spanish domination.
The rumor proved well founded. A former
officer of the revolutionists, one Gregor MacGregor,
together with José María del Real, the agent in London
of the "United Provinces of New Granada," had,
with the aid of some English merchants, fitted out an
expedition,<a name='FA_XXIV-32' id='FA_XXIV-32' href='#FN_XXIV-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-32]</a> which, consisting of three ships, carrying
417 fighting men, sailed from Gravesend on the 18th
of December, 1818, and in the following February cast
anchor off Aux Cayes in Hayti. Here they were
joined by two other vessels, and together they continued
the voyage to San Andrés, the rendezvous, of
which, on the 4th of April, 1819, they took formal
possession in the name of the United Provinces. Four
days after, the squadron appeared off Portobello and
captured the place, meeting with scarcely any resistance.
Governor Hore had expected the landing at
Chagres, and made preparation to meet the invaders.<a name='FA_XXIV-33' id='FA_XXIV-33' href='#FN_XXIV-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-33]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_499' name='Page_499' href='#Page_499'>499</a></span>
Most of the troops were forthwith landed, and the
town having been almost entirely deserted, the soldiers
found ready quarters, and garrisons were placed
in the forts, and the batteries were manned. MacGregor
issued a high-sounding bulletin, in which he
set forth that "the first division of the army of New
Granada had won immarcesible glory." Detachments
were sent out to reconnoitre, and no hostile force being
discovered, the march to Chagres and Panamá,
was spoken of as if neither nature nor the Spaniards
would offer any obstacles.<a name='FA_XXIV-34' id='FA_XXIV-34' href='#FN_XXIV-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-34]</a> Two exiles from New
Granada, José Elías Lopez and Joaquin Vargas Besga,
who had accompanied the expedition, were made governor
and vice-governor respectively. After a te
deum, and a few days time, the inhabitants of the town
who had returned to their homes were harangued to
induce them to take up arms against the Spanish
yoke. About 100 men, mostly colored, responded
to the appeal and enlisted, forming the nucleus of a
regiment called América Libre, which, under the
command of some foreign officers, was to be the advanced
guard on the march to Panamá. The scheme
proved a failure, for soon these same free Americans
disbanded or deserted, most of them joining the enemy.
</p>

<p>
The condition and general discipline of the invading
force were far from satisfactory. The men clamored
for their pay, and there being no money in the military
chest, the people were called upon to furnish
funds, which caused them to again leave the place.
Sickness also broke out among the troops, several of
the officers and men becoming victims of the climate.
Discipline was neglected, and all semblance of order
disappeared. The soldiers sold their ammunition and
effects for liquor.<a name='FA_XXIV-35' id='FA_XXIV-35' href='#FN_XXIV-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-35]</a> This same carelessness prevailed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_500' name='Page_500' href='#Page_500'>500</a></span>
even when toward the end of April news came of the
near approach of Spanish forces from Panamá. It
seems that as soon as Hore heard of the loss of Portobello
he concentrated his forces, and with about 500
men marched across the Isthmus, bent upon expelling
the invaders. Taking a route different from the usual
one, and favored by the carelessness of the English
and the thick forests surrounding Portobello, Hore
arrived near the town unperceived on the 29th of
April.
</p>

<p>
On the same day a vessel with supplies and provisions
for the invaders had arrived from Jamaica, an
event which was gayly celebrated in the town. In the
evening the alcalde and some priests took part in the
carousals, which were kept up to a late hour, with a
complete neglect of duty on the part of the officers.
At six o'clock next morning one division of Hore's
troops, under the command of Lieutenant-colonel José
de Santa Cruz, surprised the soldiers and took the town,
killing all who came in their way. Among the slain
were the newly appointed governor, Lopez, and many
of the officers, who perished either at their quarters
or while attempting to reach the fort. MacGregor
leaped over the balcony of the government house, ran
to the beach, and thence swam to one of his vessels.
Unsuccessful attacks were made on the forts, though
the beseiged were unable to use the unwieldy guns,
unsupported as they were by the vessels, which made
no preparation to aid them. The Spaniards were not
disposed to storm the forts, but knowing that the garrisons
had suffered severely, they demanded their surrender.
This was refused; and notwithstanding the
cowardly conduct of some of the officers, the negotiations
might have been broken off, but the soldiers
declined further to fight. A capitulation was then
entered into, under which the invaders, after delivering
up their arms, were to retain their baggage and
reëmbark to go whither they chose. At this juncture,
orders came from MacGregor not to surrender, giving
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_501' name='Page_501' href='#Page_501'>501</a></span>
assurance that the ships would soon be ready to open
upon the Spaniards. But the surrender had already
been made, and the men, about 340 in all, had been disarmed
and marched to the main plaza, where, instead
of being permitted to go their way, they were declared
prisoners, to be conveyed as convicts to Panamá.<a name='FA_XXIV-36' id='FA_XXIV-36' href='#FN_XXIV-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-36]</a> On
learning the result, the gallant MacGregor, from whose
coming the New Granadinos had expected so much
put to sea, leaving his companions to their fate.<a name='FA_XXIV-37' id='FA_XXIV-37' href='#FN_XXIV-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-37]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
FAILURE OF THE EXPEDITION.
</p>

<p>
The matter did not end at Portobello, however.
Hore despatched his prisoners to Panamá on the 2d
of May, and reported his achievement to Viceroy Sámano,
who commanded that the prisoners, none excepted,
should be shot.<a name='FA_XXIV-38' id='FA_XXIV-38' href='#FN_XXIV-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-38]</a> But for some reason Hore
did not carry out the order. The prisoners were, nevertheless,
subjected to cruel treatment, being kept in
chain-gangs at work on the fortifications, roads, and
streets, which, added to the ravages of the deadly
climate, soon reduced their numbers. Several of the
officers were shot afterward at Cana in Darien on the
pretext of their having attempted to escape.<a name='FA_XXIV-39' id='FA_XXIV-39' href='#FN_XXIV-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-39]</a> When
after seventeen months of suffering the release of the
survivors was ordered on September 20, 1820, only
121 remained,<a name='FA_XXIV-40' id='FA_XXIV-40' href='#FN_XXIV-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-40]</a> who were at an early day taken to
Chagres, whence they embarked for Jamaica.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_502' name='Page_502' href='#Page_502'>502</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Important events had meantime taken place in
Spain, by which constitutional régime was restored.
A change in the government of the Isthmus soon followed,
the people for the first time being called upon
to exercise the right of suffrage.<a name='FA_XXIV-41' id='FA_XXIV-41' href='#FN_XXIV-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-41]</a> The newly organized
ayuntamiento<a name='FA_XXIV-42' id='FA_XXIV-42' href='#FN_XXIV-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-42]</a> was composed of men well disposed
toward independence. The change of system
curtailing Hore's powers so preyed upon his mind that
he died.<a name='FA_XXIV-43' id='FA_XXIV-43' href='#FN_XXIV-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-43]</a> This was a serious loss to the Spanish
cause, whose interests the deceased had ever been
ready to uphold by fair or foul means.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
COMING OF SÁMANO.
</p>

<p>
Brigadier Pedro Ruiz de Porras, who succeeded
Hore in the military command, if not a partisan of independence,
was a friend of constitutional government.
The civil governor, or <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">gefe político</span>, Pedro Aguilar,
showed so much indifference that little opposition was
feared from him. The new cabildo demanded the installation
of a diputacion provincial, the election of a
deputy to the Spanish córtes, and other measures
provided for in the national constitution.<a name='FA_XXIV-44' id='FA_XXIV-44' href='#FN_XXIV-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-44]</a> These demands
were not, however, complied with. The independent
party saw the necessity of close relations with
their friends outside of Panamá, and developed them,
without disregarding the precautions demanded by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_503' name='Page_503' href='#Page_503'>503</a></span>
presence of a strong hostile garrison in their midst.
They were now greatly hindered by the sudden appearance
in Panamá, of Viceroy Sámano, who came by way
of Jamaica. His object was to establish his government
on the Isthmus, which the cabildo and constitutionalists
opposed on the ground of his having forfeited
the viceregal office by a refusal to take the oath to
support the constitution. He had been detained several
days at Las Cruces, but the military party proved
the stronger, and admitted him into the city. His
coming caused general uneasiness,<a name='FA_XXIV-45' id='FA_XXIV-45' href='#FN_XXIV-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-45]</a> as he was known
to be a man of bad temper. However, as he met
with no further opposition, and as his health was precarious,
he limited himself to levying a forced loan.<a name='FA_XXIV-46' id='FA_XXIV-46' href='#FN_XXIV-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-46]</a>
</p>

<p>
Free ideas had, however, gained too strong a hold
to be easily suppressed by the mere opposition of the
ruler, and when in 1821 a new city council was
elected, the members<a name='FA_XXIV-47' id='FA_XXIV-47' href='#FN_XXIV-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-47]</a> were again liberal-minded men.
They repeated the demand for the establishment of a
diputacion provincial, and for the election of a deputy
to the Spanish córtes; but the viceroy only returned
evasive answers. Fortunately, the province was soon
relieved of him, by his death, on the 3d of August,
1821.<a name='FA_XXIV-48' id='FA_XXIV-48' href='#FN_XXIV-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-48]</a> Then the press resumed a bold tone, and
hopes were revived in political circles. Soon after
came to succeed Sámano, the mariscal de campo Juan
de la Cruz Mourgeon.<a name='FA_XXIV-49' id='FA_XXIV-49' href='#FN_XXIV-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-49]</a> He had been appointed as
captain-general of New Granada only, with the promise
of the office of viceroy when he should have
reconquered two thirds of New Granada.<a name='FA_XXIV-50' id='FA_XXIV-50' href='#FN_XXIV-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-50]</a>
</p>

<p>
Mourgeon brought from Spain some troops, adding
to their number at Puerto Cabello in Venezuela. His
rule was based on principles entirely opposite to those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_504' name='Page_504' href='#Page_504'>504</a></span>
of his predecessor, namely, on the constitution and
the new organic laws of the monarchy. Members
for the diputacion provincial and a deputy to the
Spanish córtes were elected, and the former was
installed amidst the usual demonstrations. This liberal
policy permeated his whole administration; the
press was protected, patriotic societies were formed,
and to strengthen the ties between Spaniards and
Americans a masonic lodge was founded, and offices
of trust and honor were bestowed on men from both
branches. Every effort was made by the new ruler
to do away with the old rivalry. But it all came too
late. The idea of independence had become deeply
rooted, and could not be affected by the new policy,
the duration of which was also uncertain. The natives
of the Isthmus exhibited a remarkable circumspection,
which deluded the captain-general and the
Spaniards. Mourgeon felt confident of Panamá's
loyalty, and still more so after José de Fábrega, a
native of the Isthmus, was appointed temporary comandante
of Tierra Firme;<a name='FA_XXIV-51' id='FA_XXIV-51' href='#FN_XXIV-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-51]</a> and began to think of
securing his promised viceregal office by the reconquest
of Quito or Ecuador. He accordingly set
himself to make preparations for that undertaking;
but the impoverished condition of Isthmian finances
greatly hampered him. Nevertheless, though with
the utmost difficulty,<a name='FA_XXIV-52' id='FA_XXIV-52' href='#FN_XXIV-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-52]</a> he fitted out a squadron, composed
of the corvette <i>Alejandro</i>, and three schooners,
on which he embarked two battalions of infantry, two
dismounted squadrons of cavalry, and some artillerymen;
and assuming personal command of the force,
set sail on the 22d of October, 1821.<a name='FA_XXIV-53' id='FA_XXIV-53' href='#FN_XXIV-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-53]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SUB-REVOLUTION.
</p>

<p>
This was the most propitious opportunity the friends
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_505' name='Page_505' href='#Page_505'>505</a></span>
of independence could hope for, and they lost no time
in availing themselves of it. Secret meetings were
held, at which they matured their plans. While thus
engaged at Panamá, a revolutionary movement broke
out in the villa de Los Santos, which, not being the
result of any preconcerted plan, caused the greatest
alarm at the capital. The outbreak had been, indeed,
one which merely proclaimed independence, without
pretending to establish any form of government.<a name='FA_XXIV-54' id='FA_XXIV-54' href='#FN_XXIV-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-54]</a>
The governor, local authorities, and other prominent
officials, after a hasty consultation, resolved upon
gentle means to quell the disturbance, and commissioners
were despatched at once to Los Santos to
restore peace if possible.<a name='FA_XXIV-55' id='FA_XXIV-55' href='#FN_XXIV-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-55]</a> But the more impatient
among the friends of independence hoped that their
mission would fail, and that the spirit of sedition,
known to exist throughout the Isthmus, would boldly
assert itself as soon as the capital should give the
signal. But this signal could not as yet be given.
Both the cabildo and diputacion countenanced the
revolution, and it was believed that Fábrega would
not oppose a movement to free his own country; but
resistance was certain from the troops of the garrison.
Any sudden insurrection would, therefore, be untimely,
and probably end in disaster.
</p>

<p>
New plans were devised, and it was finally resolved
to undermine the military power by encouraging
desertions,<a name='FA_XXIV-56' id='FA_XXIV-56' href='#FN_XXIV-56' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-56]</a> and at the same time to spread among the
masses the scheme of independence. Four prominent
citizens<a name='FA_XXIV-57' id='FA_XXIV-57' href='#FN_XXIV-57' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-57]</a> undertook the first task, to facilitate which
a fund was raised, and were very successful. Desertions
became frequent, and their number increased
from day to day, till the government began to suspect
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_506' name='Page_506' href='#Page_506'>506</a></span>
the cause, but the independent agents were reticent.
Measures were adopted which only partially succeeded
in checking desertions. The garrison was soon so
reduced that there were hardly men enough to guard
the jail, hospital, and powder magazine. In the night
of November 27, 1821, sixty soldiers disappeared,
together with their muskets.<a name='FA_XXIV-58' id='FA_XXIV-58' href='#FN_XXIV-58' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-58]</a> The government now
became convinced that a revolution was impending,
and took measures to resist it. The few remaining
troops were distributed in the most convenient places,
and artillery was placed at street-crossings.
</p>

<p>
The day so anxiously waited for, the memorable
day in the history of the Isthmus, came at last. On
the 28th of November, 1821, at the call of a number
of citizens, the ayuntamiento held a session, and the
governor, diputacion provincial, bishop, and other chief
officials were invited to take part in their deliberations.
The meeting was held with open doors; people might
come and go as they chose. The question was, Should
or should not the Isthmus of Panamá declare its independence
from Spain? A motion to that end met
with approval.<a name='FA_XXIV-59' id='FA_XXIV-59' href='#FN_XXIV-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-59]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DECLARATION AND REORGANIZATION.
</p>

<p>
The next subject discussed was the form of government
to be adopted, which resulted in a voluntary
annexation to the republic of Colombia,<a name='FA_XXIV-60' id='FA_XXIV-60' href='#FN_XXIV-60' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-60]</a> to whose
general congress the Isthmus was to accredit a deputy.
Other resolutions were passed concerning the military
force in the state,<a name='FA_XXIV-61' id='FA_XXIV-61' href='#FN_XXIV-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-61]</a> and the organization of a new
government, which was intrusted to the former governor,
José de Fábrega, who now assumed the title,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_507' name='Page_507' href='#Page_507'>507</a></span>
Jefe Superior del Istmo. All the civil, municipal,
and ecclesiastical authorities were to continue in office,
and in the same manner the existing laws were to
remain in force, when not conflicting with the independence,
and until a new code could be framed.
Fábrega was directed to adopt measures for preserving
peace, to obtain the surrender of Chagres and
Portobello, and to raise a loan to meet necessary expenses.
The several authorities and officials of all
grades were to take the oath of allegiance, and copies
of the proceedings were to be circulated, together with
requests for pecuniary contributions. A special committee
then drew up a formal minute of the declaration
and of the resolutions passed, and amid the cheers of
the multitude, the document was signed by José de
Fábrega, the bishop José Higinio Duran y Martel, a
number of other citizens,<a name='FA_XXIV-62' id='FA_XXIV-62' href='#FN_XXIV-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-62]</a> and the public notary José
de los Santos Correoso. Thus ended the 28th of November,
1821.<a name='FA_XXIV-63' id='FA_XXIV-63' href='#FN_XXIV-63' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-63]</a> Two days later the support of the
declaration of independence was publicly sworn to with
great solemnity, and on the 1st of December a similar
proclamation was made at Santiago de Veragua.<a name='FA_XXIV-64' id='FA_XXIV-64' href='#FN_XXIV-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-64]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the day, however, that the celebration occurred
at Panamá, the inhabitants were thrown into consternation
by the arrival of two Spanish frigates accompanied
by Mourgeon's transports. It was at first
feared that he had returned from Ecuador,<a name='FA_XXIV-65' id='FA_XXIV-65' href='#FN_XXIV-65' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-65]</a> till it
was ascertained that the war ships had come in quest
of the general, and the transports for reënforcements.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_508' name='Page_508' href='#Page_508'>508</a></span>
The alarm was well founded, for the place had no means
of defence. Nevertheless, the authorities made preparations
for resistance, and the town soon assumed a warlike
appearance. The suspense lasted six days, at the
end of which the commanders of the frigates offered
to surrender to the new government, the only condition
required in return being that the latter should
pay the wages due the crews. It will be a matter of
surprise that so modest a demand was not complied
with. It is true that the treasury was empty, but it
does not appear that any efforts were made to procure
the funds. An agreement was, however, entered into,
the two commanders binding themselves not to assail
the Isthmus, nor afford aid to Mourgeon, but to surrender
to the government of Peru, which was done.<a name='FA_XXIV-66' id='FA_XXIV-66' href='#FN_XXIV-66' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-66]</a>
</p>

<p>
About the time that Panamá became free, other
Spanish colonies also secured their independence.
Consequently, Panamá found no difficulty to effect a
union with the then republic of Colombia, whose constitution,
framed in the latter part of 1821,<a name='FA_XXIV-67' id='FA_XXIV-67' href='#FN_XXIV-67' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-67]</a> became the
political groundwork of Tierra Firme. In January,
1822, Fábrega assured the people that there was no
further cause to fear Mourgeon's attacks, should he
attempt them; troops in sufficient number for defence
had arrived; but funds for their support were at the
same time called for. However, as late as October,
1827, there were apprehensions of a Spanish invasion,
and Bolívar, the president of Colombia, issued a military
order for the protection of the coast.<a name='FA_XXIV-68' id='FA_XXIV-68' href='#FN_XXIV-68' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-68]</a> Early in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_509' name='Page_509' href='#Page_509'>509</a></span>
February 1822, José María Carreño was appointed
intendente and comandante general of the Isthmus,
with a command independent from Cartagena, and
Fábrega was made governor and comandante general
of Alange, Veragua, and annexes.<a name='FA_XXIV-69' id='FA_XXIV-69' href='#FN_XXIV-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXIV-69]</a> This same year

ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.

The republican government, among its first acts,
not only prohibited the importation of African slaves,
but made provision for extinguishing slavery within

purchase their own freedom, and all children born of
slave parents after the 21st of June, 1821, were declared
free, the masters being required to feed, clothe,

<p class="sidenote">PANAMÁ CONGRESS OF NATIONS.
</p>

<p>
Owing to its geographical position, Panamá was
selected as the place of meeting of a congress of
American states, called at the suggestion of Bolívar,
the liberator of South America, in 1822, for the purpose,
as it was understood, of devising measures to
counteract the menacing plans of the so-called holy
alliance of European monarchs.<a name='FA_XXV-1' id='FA_XXV-1' href='#FN_XXV-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-1]</a> The government of
the United States being invited to send representatives
agreed to do so, and did appoint plenipotentiaries, declining,
however, to bind itself to any course of action,
but to remain a passive witness of the proceedings, so
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_511' name='Page_511' href='#Page_511'>511</a></span>
long as the executive and congress should be in ignorance
of the real aims and tendencies of that assembly.
Its representatives did not take any part in the deliberations.<a name='FA_XXV-2' id='FA_XXV-2' href='#FN_XXV-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-2]</a>
England, which had recognized the independence
of Colombia in 1824, and Holland, having
been likewise invited to be present by commissioners,
partly complied, but refrained from participating in
the work of the congress.<a name='FA_XXV-3' id='FA_XXV-3' href='#FN_XXV-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
The congress assembled on the 22d of June, 1826,
the only American nations therein represented being
Colombia, Central America, Peru, and Mexico.<a name='FA_XXV-4' id='FA_XXV-4' href='#FN_XXV-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-4]</a> Chile
had reluctantly promised her attendance, but failed
to comply, owing to civil war. Buenos Aires refused
her coöperation. Without waiting for further arrivals,
the commissioners present entered into certain covenants,
establishing the contingent of land and naval
forces each nation was to contribute to the projected
league; and likewise agreeing upon the points to be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_512' name='Page_512' href='#Page_512'>512</a></span>
submitted to the acceptance of the several allies.
Some not very practical propositions were agreed to.<a name='FA_XXV-5' id='FA_XXV-5' href='#FN_XXV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-5]</a>
Bolívar was displeased at the course of affairs, and
disappointed at the failure of a plan which, if realized,
would have been his crown of glory.<a name='FA_XXV-6' id='FA_XXV-6' href='#FN_XXV-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-6]</a> He thereupon
turned his attention to other objects.
</p>

<p>
The congress then adjourned to meet again at
Tacubaya in Mexico. This step was attributed to
the influence of the Mexican plenipotentiary Michelena,
who, it has been said, had in view to secure his
country's predominance in America.<a name='FA_XXV-7' id='FA_XXV-7' href='#FN_XXV-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-7]</a> It was also
resolved at the adjournment that the legations should
divide themselves, one member from each going to
report to his government what had been done, and
the others repairing at once to Mexico. The ministers
of Colombia and Central America, after waiting
two years in vain for the ratification by Mexico of
the treaties, had finally to depart, deeply regretting
the dissolution of a body upon which Spanish America
had centred her hopes, and the enlightened world had
so long fixed its attention.<a name='FA_XXV-8' id='FA_XXV-8' href='#FN_XXV-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-8]</a>

A congress held in Angostura,<a name='FA_XXV-9' id='FA_XXV-9' href='#FN_XXV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-9]</a> in December 1819,
under the presidency of Simon Bolívar, constituted
the republic of Colombia, with the former viceroyalty

of Caracas or Venezuela. One of its

<p>
Civil war broke out in 1831. Colonel Alzuru,
who had arrived from Guayaquil with troops, by the
instigation of some prominent men, rose in arms in
Panamá to detach the provinces from Nueva Granada.
On the news reaching Bogotá, the national government
despatched Colonel Tomás Herrera with a force
to quell the rebellion; and upon his approaching the
city, the more prominent families fled to the island of
Tabogá. Those who had prompted Alzuru's act now
forsook him, and rendered aid to Herrera, with all the
information they possessed. The rebels were attacked
on their way to La Chorrera, while crossing marshy
ground, and defeated. Alzuru was taken prisoner,
tried by court-martial, and shot in the cathedral plaza
of Panamá.

General José Fábrega restored order in Veragua,
and made it known to the general government on the
30th of August.<a name='FA_XXV-16' id='FA_XXV-16' href='#FN_XXV-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-16]</a> The garrison at Panamá, together

their unswerving fealty.<a name='FA_XXV-17' id='FA_XXV-17' href='#FN_XXV-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-17]</a> Later, in March 1832, an
attempt was made by two subalterns<a name='FA_XXV-18' id='FA_XXV-18' href='#FN_XXV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-18]</a> to induce the
sergeants of their battalion to join them in a conspiracy
for upsetting the government. The two officers
were tried and executed, and two of the sergeants
sent into exile. Chaos reigned throughout the republic
in 1840; then came revolution. The chief men
of Panamá met in a junta and resolved to detach the
Isthmus and form an independent republic. Cárlos
Icaza, the governor, who was a Panameño, signified
his acquiescence, and the proclamation of independence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_515' name='Page_515' href='#Page_515'>515</a></span>
was made, Tomás Herrera assuming by appointment
of the junta the office of jefe superior, on the
18th of November, 1840.<a name='FA_XXV-19' id='FA_XXV-19' href='#FN_XXV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-19]</a> On the 21st the governor
of Veragua, Cárlos Fábrega, was asked to join the
movement; but he answered from Santiago on the
29th declining;<a name='FA_XXV-20' id='FA_XXV-20' href='#FN_XXV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-20]</a> whereupon Herrera issued addresses,

march with troops to Veragua.<a name='FA_XXV-21' id='FA_XXV-21' href='#FN_XXV-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-21]</a> The expedition,
however, marched only a part of the distance, the
people of Veragua submitting to the force of necessity.
The independence existed de facto nearly two
years. In 1841 Tomás Herrera and Cárlos de Icaza
were chosen president and vice-president, respectively,
of the ephemeral republic. Mariano Arosemena, secretary
of foreign affairs, despatched Pedro de Obarrio
as a special commissioner to the government of Costa
Rica to notify it of the organization of the state of
the Isthmus, and apply for its formal recognition.<a name='FA_XXV-22' id='FA_XXV-22' href='#FN_XXV-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-22]</a>

were protected, and commerce was liberally
encouraged.<a name='FA_XXV-23' id='FA_XXV-23' href='#FN_XXV-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-23]</a>

<p>
The government had carefully avoided the commission
of any act of hostility against Nueva Granada;
but the time came when news reached Panamá that
the government of Bogotá was fitting out a force to
bring the Isthmus into subjection. Whereupon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_516' name='Page_516' href='#Page_516'>516</a></span>
officers of the British chargé d'affaires at Bogotá were
asked to obtain the consent of Nueva Granada to receive
a commissioner in the interest of peace.<a name='FA_XXV-24' id='FA_XXV-24' href='#FN_XXV-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-24]</a> But
the other parts of Nueva Granada having become
pacified in the course of 1841, two commissioners came
from the general government, and the people of
Panamá, being convinced of the folly of resistance,
peacefully submitted.<a name='FA_XXV-25' id='FA_XXV-25' href='#FN_XXV-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-25]</a> Herrera so managed that he
was appointed governor of the restored province.<a name='FA_XXV-26' id='FA_XXV-26' href='#FN_XXV-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-26]</a>
The constitutional reforms of 1842 and 1843 tended

against acts of the officials on the Isthmus, the relations
of the national government with foreign powers
have been at times complicated. The first difficulty
arose from the arrest in 1836 of Russell, the British
vice-consul, and led to the blockade of the whole
Atlantic coast of the republic, which finally compelled
Nueva Granada to submit to such terms as
the British commander chose to impose.<a name='FA_XXV-34' id='FA_XXV-34' href='#FN_XXV-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-34]</a> Another

RAN RUNNELS' ISTHMUS GUARD.
</p>

<p>
On the 26th of January, 1854, the consuls of the
United States, France, Great Britain, Brazil, Portugal,
Denmark, Peru, and Ecuador addressed a protest
to the governor of Panamá, against the neglect of his
government to afford protection to passengers crossing
the Isthmus, notwithstanding that each passenger
was made to pay the sum of two dollars for the privilege
of landing and going from one sea to the other.<a name='FA_XXV-36' id='FA_XXV-36' href='#FN_XXV-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-36]</a>
Governor Urrutia Añino, on the 14th of February,
denied the alleged neglect, as well as the right of
those officials who had no recognition from the New
Granadan government to address him in such a manner.
He pointed to the public jail, which was full of
prisoners, some already undergoing punishment, and
others being tried or awaiting trial. He also reminded
the consuls that only a short time had elapsed since
three men were executed for crimes.<a name='FA_XXV-37' id='FA_XXV-37' href='#FN_XXV-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-37]</a> It was a fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_519' name='Page_519' href='#Page_519'>519</a></span>
nevertheless, that the government could not cope with
the situation—the Isthmus being infested with criminals
from all parts of the earth, that had been drawn
thereto by the prospect of plunder—in view of which
a number of citizens and respectable foreigners combined
in organizing the Isthmus guard, whose chief
was Ran Runnels, charged with the duty of guarding
the route between Panamá and Colon, and empowered
to punish even with death all persons guilty
of crimes. Urrutia Añino, the governor, unhesitatingly
acquiesced in the arrangement.<a name='FA_XXV-38' id='FA_XXV-38' href='#FN_XXV-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-38]</a>

Americans had occasional misunderstandings with
the authorities, a notable one occurring in 1855, when
the local governor of Panamá returned unopened an
official letter from the consul of the United States,
who at once threatened to strike his flag; but the
matter was settled amicably by the chief officers of
the Isthmus.<a name='FA_XXV-39' id='FA_XXV-39' href='#FN_XXV-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-39]</a> A more serious affair was the demand
of the state government that steamships arriving at
Panamá or Colon should pay tonnage money.<a name='FA_XXV-40' id='FA_XXV-40' href='#FN_XXV-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-40]</a> This
raised the protest of the American consul and the
railway and steamship agents. The controversy was
finally terminated by the executive of the republic declaring
that the law under which the tonnage money
was claimed had been enacted by the state of Panamá,
without any right to legislate on such matters, as they
were of the exclusive province of the general government.<a name='FA_XXV-41' id='FA_XXV-41' href='#FN_XXV-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-41]</a>

<p>
As might have been expected, exaggerated accounts
of this affray flew far and wide. The official report,
however, showed smaller figures, though bad enough—of
foreigners, 15 slain and 16 wounded, of whom
one died afterward; of natives, 2 killed and 13
wounded. The conduct of the police and people was
certainly most blamable. The affair might, perhaps,
have been averted if the authorities had shown proper
energy. I will admit, however, that there was cause
of provocation.<a name='FA_XXV-44' id='FA_XXV-44' href='#FN_XXV-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
Consequent on this affair, the city of Panamá,
which, owing to the misgovernment of previous years,
was already on the decline, had to suffer still more.
Many business houses closed their doors, because the
American transient passengers, who during their stay
were wont to scatter gold, thenceforth remained on
shore only a few minutes.<a name='FA_XXV-45' id='FA_XXV-45' href='#FN_XXV-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-45]</a> Much diplomatic correspondence
passed between the American and New
Granadan governments on the subject, the former sending
a commissioner to Panamá, to investigate the circumstances,<a name='FA_XXV-46' id='FA_XXV-46' href='#FN_XXV-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-46]</a>
and finally claiming a large indemnity.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_522' name='Page_522' href='#Page_522'>522</a></span>
At last a convention was concluded on the 10th of
September, 1857, between Secretary Cass, and General
P. A. Herran, minister of New Granada, for the
settlement of all claims, the latter having acknowledged
the responsibility of his government for the
injuries and damages caused by the riot.<a name='FA_XXV-47' id='FA_XXV-47' href='#FN_XXV-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-47]</a>
</p>

<p>
The relations with Americans on the Isthmus continued
to be unsatisfactory for some time longer.
Notwithstanding that New Granada was apparently
inclined to cordiality, cases of injustice or ill treatment
to American citizens often occurring, at last the president
of the United States asked congress, on the 18th
of February, 1859, for power to protect Americans on
the Isthmus.<a name='FA_XXV-48' id='FA_XXV-48' href='#FN_XXV-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-48]</a> In later years Americans have seldom
had any serious cause of complaint.
</p>

<p>
The question of neutrality of the Isthmus has occasionally
been on the tapis. A case in point occurred
in 1864, during the sectional war in the United States,
when a number of southern confederates went on
board the American steamer <i>Salvador</i> at Panamá,
with the purpose of seizing her at sea, and turning
her—as she had guns on board—into a confederate
cruiser, to be used in capturing the first treasure
steamer from California. The men engaged in the
enterprise were themselves arrested at sea on the
<i>Salvador</i>,<a name='FA_XXV-49' id='FA_XXV-49' href='#FN_XXV-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-49]</a> by an American war vessel. The admiral,
Pearson, asked the government of Panamá for permission
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_523' name='Page_523' href='#Page_523'>523</a></span>
to send the prisoners overland to Colon, where
they might be embarked for New York. The request
was refused;<a name='FA_XXV-50' id='FA_XXV-50' href='#FN_XXV-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-50]</a> in consequence of which the prisoners
were sent to San Francisco.<a name='FA_XXV-51' id='FA_XXV-51' href='#FN_XXV-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-51]</a>
</p>

<p>
At the commencement of the French intervention
in Mexico, the legislature of Panamá asked the general
government of Colombia to allow no French
troops to pass over the Isthmus. The United States
government was not called upon to aid this policy.
In the autumn of 1864 a body of French marines
arrived at Colon to cross to the Pacific and replace
invalids of the fleet on the Mexican coast. The president
of Panamá refused them a pass, and asked the
railroad company not to transport them. The French
officers argued that American and English troops had
on several occasions been allowed to cross. It so
happened that at this time some American soldiers
arrived and crossed over to the Pacific under a permit
previously granted by the former president of the
state. The French then alleging the so-called 'most-favored-nation'
clause also crossed over.<a name='FA_XXV-52' id='FA_XXV-52' href='#FN_XXV-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-52]</a>

Whilst the Isthmus was under the direct rule of the

had no effect detrimental to public morals, nor to
the obedience paid by the people to the authorities.

<p>
Nevertheless, the white population of Panamá had
been for some time past discontented with the general
government, and a desire had sprung up to get rid of
a yoke which was deemed oppressive. The supreme
authorities at Bogotá were not unaware of this, and
whether prompted by the fear of losing the territory,
or by a sentiment of justice, or by both, concluded to
allow the Isthmians the privilege of controlling their
local affairs, which was hailed with joy by all classes.
An additional clause to the national constitution was
then enacted by the New Granadan congress, on the
27th of February, 1855, by which Panamá was made
a state, and a member of the confederation with the
four provinces of Panamá, Azuero, Chiriquí, and Veragua,<a name='FA_XXV-59' id='FA_XXV-59' href='#FN_XXV-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-59]</a>

Panamá on the 15th of July to constitute the state.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_526' name='Page_526' href='#Page_526'>526</a></span>
The assembly was presided over by Francisco Fábrega,
and on the 18th passed an act for the provisional
organization of the state. Justo Arosemena, being
chosen jefe superior provisorio, took possession of office
at once, and appointed Cárlos Icaza Arosemena government
secretary.<a name='FA_XXV-61' id='FA_XXV-61' href='#FN_XXV-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-61]</a> The city of Panamá was declared
to be the capital, and residence of the superior authorities
of the state.
</p>

<p>
The constitution of the now entitled <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Estado de
Panamá</span> was promulgated on the 17th of September,
1855. It was a liberal instrument, including freedom
of religion. The executive authority was vested in
a governor, who was to assume the office on the 1st
of October of the following year, and hold it two
years. A vice-governor and two designados were also
to be elected by popular vote, to take charge of affairs
should the governor die or be otherwise disenabled to
discharge his duties. In the absence or inability of
all the elect, then the superior civil authority of the
capital was to act as governor.<a name='FA_XXV-62' id='FA_XXV-62' href='#FN_XXV-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-62]</a> A misunderstanding

Notwithstanding the hopes of a bright future, from
this time the Isthmus was the theatre of almost
perpetual political trouble, and revolution became
chronic, preventing any possible advancement. In
1856 there was a stormy electoral campaign,<a name='FA_XXV-64' id='FA_XXV-64' href='#FN_XXV-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-64]</a> that
culminated in a coup d'etat, for which the responsibility

DISPUTED ELECTION.
</p>

<p>
The election for governor took place on the 15th of
August, 1856. The white element claimed Bartolomé
Calvo, a colored man from Cartagena, and a conservative
in politics, to have been elected by 4,000 majority.
The negroes insisted that Manuel M. Diaz, a white
man, had been chosen. The declaration by the legislature
as to who was the elect had not been made, as
required by law, by the 15th of September. The
radicals then demanded that the vice-governor, who
was in their interest, should assume the executive.
On the 15th of September trouble was expected
against the white men, many of whom took refuge
on the American sloop of war <i>St Mary's</i>.<a name='FA_XXV-66' id='FA_XXV-66' href='#FN_XXV-66' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-66]</a> Calvo was

to have been constitutionally chosen for two
years; and Francisco Fábrega the vice-governor.<a name='FA_XXV-67' id='FA_XXV-67' href='#FN_XXV-67' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-67]</a>
If not a man of high order of talent, Calvo possessed
good judgment, and he eventually succeeded in making
himself respected, even by those who opposed his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_528' name='Page_528' href='#Page_528'>528</a></span>
election. His course was moderate, and it may be
said of him that he was an honest man, and his administration
a successful one. The finances were
improved, and public education was encouraged.<a name='FA_XXV-68' id='FA_XXV-68' href='#FN_XXV-68' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-68]</a>
After serving nineteen months he resigned office and
left the state.<a name='FA_XXV-69' id='FA_XXV-69' href='#FN_XXV-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-69]</a> Ramon Gamboa, as first designado,
succeeded him for the rest of the term.
</p>

<p>
José de Obaldía was chosen by popular vote over
J. M. Hurtado, the government candidate, amid a
great political commotion, his election being recognized
by the legislature at midnight. His term began
on the 1st of October, 1858. Obaldía was one of the
most talented and best informed men in the republic,
and an eloquent orator. However, though a power
in the tribune, he proved himself unfitted for a ruler.<a name='FA_XXV-70' id='FA_XXV-70' href='#FN_XXV-70' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-70]</a>
During his term, on the 17th of April, 1859, the colored

negro vote. In September 1860 the states of Cauca
and Bolívar seceded from Nueva Granada, and formed
a confederation under the name of Estados Unidos de
Colombia, with General T. C. Mosquera at the head.
By a clause of their agreement any other state opposing
them was to be conquered and annexed. Wishing
to keep Panamá neutral in the horrible struggle going
on in the rest of the republic, Guardia entered into a
convention on the 6th of September, 1861, with Manuel
Murillo Toro, who represented those states, by which
Panamá was to join the confederacy, but to take no
active part in the family quarrel.<a name='FA_XXV-74' id='FA_XXV-74' href='#FN_XXV-74' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-74]</a> Early in July
1862 the state assumed the official name of Estado
Soberano de Panamá, which it has retained to the
present time.
</p>

<p>
This contest, out of which the liberal party came
triumphant throughout the country, was known as
'la revolucion de Mosquera.' The minister of Nueva
Granada in Washington, on the plea that a mere
naval force could not afford security to the Isthmus
transit, asked the United States to provide also a
land force of 300 cavalry, but the request was not

<p>
The efforts of Guardia to keep the Isthmus out of
the general turmoil were of no avail. A force of about
150 or 200 men under General Santa Coloma came
from Cartagena to Colon, with the apparent purpose
of enabling the governor to carry out certain liberal
measures. The latter protested against such a violation
of a solemn agreement; but the force insisted on
coming across to Panamá, and there was no way of
preventing it. In the course of a few weeks Guardia,
being convinced that he was being employed as a puppet,
removed himself and the capital to Santiago de
Veragua. As soon as he was gone, with the connivance
of Santa Coloma, a party of men, all but one of
whom were of the colored race, assembled at the town
hall and deposed Guardia, naming one of their own
party, Manuel M. Diaz, provisional governor.<a name='FA_XXV-76' id='FA_XXV-76' href='#FN_XXV-76' class='fnanchor'>[XXV-76]</a> A

BLACK PROCEEDINGS.
</p>

<p>
The negroes were in despair, as they could find no
means of seizing the government. From the time of
Guardia's deposal they had been enjoying the public
spoils, and could not bear the idea of being kept out
of them, when their number was four or five times
larger than that of the white men. The success of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_535' name='Page_535' href='#Page_535'>535</a></span>
Olarte's plans would be the death of their aspirations,
which were the control of public affairs, by ousting
the whites, who were mostly conservatives.<a name='FA_XXVI-13' id='FA_XXVI-13' href='#FN_XXVI-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-13]</a> It became,
therefore, a necessity to rid the country of that
ogre; and as this could not be done by force of arms,
poison was resorted to. The plan was well matured,
and carried out in San Miguel, one of the Pearl
Islands, where Olarte went upon an official visit.
Olarte's death occurred on the 3d of March, 1868,
without his knowing that he had been poisoned. This
crime was not the act of one man, but of a whole
political party, which took care to have the death
attributed to a malignant fever. It became public,
however, through the family of another man, who
also became a victim.<a name='FA_XXVI-14' id='FA_XXVI-14' href='#FN_XXVI-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-14]</a> No official or post-mortem
examination was made, and the matter was hushed
up.
</p>

<p>
Olarte's death was greatly deplored by the better
class of the community, and high honors were paid to
his remains,<a name='FA_XXVI-15' id='FA_XXVI-15' href='#FN_XXVI-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-15]</a> by the legislature and the community,
the foreign consuls and their countrymen joining. In
the absence of the first designado, Manuel Amador
Guerrero, the second, Juan José Diaz, took the reins
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_536' name='Page_536' href='#Page_536'>536</a></span>
of government.<a name='FA_XXVI-16' id='FA_XXVI-16' href='#FN_XXVI-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-16]</a> His tenure of the presidential office
was a short one, however; for in the morning of the
5th of July, a revolution by the black men of the
arrabal broke out in Panamá, headed by General
Fernando Ponce, commander of the national forces,
and Diaz was overthrown.<a name='FA_XXVI-17' id='FA_XXVI-17' href='#FN_XXVI-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-17]</a> They said that the liberal
party had been cheated out of its majority at the
late election for deputies, by the unlawful devices of
its conservative opponents; and it was but logical to
conclude that the same practices would be again resorted
to at the coming election of president of the
state.<a name='FA_XXVI-18' id='FA_XXVI-18' href='#FN_XXVI-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-18]</a> There was really no cause for this revolution.
The excuses alleged by the promoters were frivolous.
They only wanted to seize power and secure the
spoils.
</p>

<p>
Ponce was placed at the head of affairs as provisional
president, to rule in accordance with the national
and state constitutions, and existing laws; and in his
absence, the following persons, in the order named,
were to assume the duties: Buenaventura Correoso,
Pablo Arosemena, Mateo Iturralde, Pedro Goitia,
and Juan Mendoza.<a name='FA_XXVI-19' id='FA_XXVI-19' href='#FN_XXVI-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-19]</a> Thus was the movement accomplished;
a provisional government was recognized by
the foreign consuls, and by four of the interior departments,
which submitted to the change rather than
become involved in civil war. On the 20th of July a
general amnesty was decreed.<a name='FA_XXVI-20' id='FA_XXVI-20' href='#FN_XXVI-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-20]</a>

PANAMÁ AND CHIRIQUÍ.

<p>
The situation was by no means enviable. The military
element was not united, much animosity existing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_537' name='Page_537' href='#Page_537'>537</a></span>
between the state battalion 'Panamá,' and the
'Santander,' which led to a second revolution on the
29th of August, and Ponce resigned the presidency
to Buenaventura Correoso,<a name='FA_XXVI-21' id='FA_XXVI-21' href='#FN_XXVI-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-21]</a> who received it on the
next day. Cárlos Icaza Arosemena was appointed
secretary of state. Correoso<a name='FA_XXVI-22' id='FA_XXVI-22' href='#FN_XXVI-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-22]</a> was not permitted to
enjoy his office peaceably. He used his best endeavors
to that end; but was erelong summoned to crush
a revolt of the conservatives in Chiriquí, at the head
of which were the prefect of that department, and
Colonel Arístides Obaldía, a son of the ex-president.
</p>

<p>
The conservatives desired change. To accomplish
this, the people of the interior armed themselves to
come to the capital and crush the negro element.<a name='FA_XXVI-23' id='FA_XXVI-23' href='#FN_XXVI-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-23]</a>
Correoso sailed with a considerable force provided

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_538' name='Page_538' href='#Page_538'>538</a></span>
men on the 16th of November. The conservatives,
about 400 strong, under Obaldía, attacked Correoso's
force of about equal number, at the Hatillo, near Santiago,
and were defeated,<a name='FA_XXVI-25' id='FA_XXVI-25' href='#FN_XXVI-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-25]</a> after which, the government
of the 29th of August being proclaimed, prisoners were
set at liberty. The revolution was at an end. Correoso
then summoned a constituent assembly, which
elected him constitutional president for the term of
four years ending September 30, 1873. With occasional
attempts at disturbance, which were successfully
quelled or peaceably adjusted, Correoso held the office
till the 1st of October, 1872, when he resigned it, and
was succeeded by Gabriel Neira to fill the rest of the
term. Neira was not permitted to hold the position
long, for a little before eleven o'clock in the forenoon
of April 5, 1873, the revolutionary party of the arrabal,
headed by Rafael Aizpuru, commander of the state
troops, and fourth designado, revolted against the
government, marched into the city, and made prisoners
President Neira and Secretary Eladio Briceño.
Dámaso Cervera, as fifth designado, was called by the
superior court to the presidency.<a name='FA_XXVI-26' id='FA_XXVI-26' href='#FN_XXVI-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-26]</a>

The national force having taken part in the troubles,
its efficiency to protect the transit was rendered doubtful,

Steedman.<a name='FA_XXVI-28' id='FA_XXVI-28' href='#FN_XXVI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-28]</a> Finally, terms of peace were arranged
in the evening of May 9th, based on the conditions
that Neira's government should be reëstablished.
The state militia surrendered their arms to the foreign

duties of the state force. Meantime, till Neira's return,
Colonel Juan Pernett was to act as president.<a name='FA_XXVI-29' id='FA_XXVI-29' href='#FN_XXVI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-29]</a>

The people of the arrabal made another disturbance
on the 24th of September, attacking the government
outposts at Playa Prieta. Hostilities were continued
during twelve or fourteen days, when the rebels, under
Correoso, abandoned their ground, and were afterward
defeated in the country. Meantime an American
force of nearly 200 men, sent on shore by
Rear-admiral Alony, a second time within four months,

The minister resident of the United States, William
L. Scruggs, on the 19th of December, 1873, laid before
the Colombian government, of which Colunje was
secretary for foreign affairs, a protest of the Panamá
railway company upon the recent disturbances of the
Isthmus, and a demand that the transit should in future
be under the immediate protection of the Colombian
government against the acts of violence of local factions.<a name='FA_XXVI-33' id='FA_XXVI-33' href='#FN_XXVI-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-33]</a>
The latter acknowledged the justice of this

future there would be a national force stationed in
Panamá, for the purpose of protecting the transit.

On the 1st of October the constituent assembly,
which had been summoned on the 1st of August, assembled.
Neira sent in his resignation, requesting
the appointment of a chief of the executive who could

Neira having attempted in the morning of the
14th of November to make a revolution with the Herrera
battalion for the purpose of setting aside the

himself, that body met at 8 o'clock and deposed him.
Whereupon Gregorio Miró, the first designado, was
summoned to assume the executive for the term ending
September 30, 1875, which he did on the 16th,<a name='FA_XXVI-37' id='FA_XXVI-37' href='#FN_XXVI-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-37]</a>
appointing José M. Bermudez his secretary of state,

These two departments of government were
abolished on the 25th of July, 1874, and the office of

<p>
Miró's administration was a restless one, owing to
constant conspiracies based on various causes. The
last one was headed by Rafael Aizpuru, who claimed

that stormy period of Colombian history.<a name='FA_XXVI-40' id='FA_XXVI-40' href='#FN_XXVI-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-40]</a> An attempt

The latter took the field, leaving Juan J. Diaz, the
second designado, in charge of the executive; but
after some unsuccessful efforts to quell the rebellion,
his official term came to an end, and Pablo Arosemena<a name='FA_XXVI-41' id='FA_XXVI-41' href='#FN_XXVI-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-41]</a>
succeeded him on the 1st of October; but he

of the federal force,<a name='FA_XXVI-42' id='FA_XXVI-42' href='#FN_XXVI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-42]</a> and Rafael Aizpuru was

A constituent assembly, presided over by B. Correoso,
met on the 25th of November, and on the 28th

Buenaventura Correoso, having been elected, assumed
the presidential office on the 1st of January,
1878; but being worried by the frequent disturbances,
and desirous of averting further scandals, resigned
in December following, and was succeeded by the
designado José Ricardo Casorla.<a name='FA_XXVI-49' id='FA_XXVI-49' href='#FN_XXVI-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-49]</a> This president was
disturbed by two revolutions. The first was occasioned

that the state authorities were hostile to the national
government.<a name='FA_XXVI-50' id='FA_XXVI-50' href='#FN_XXVI-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-50]</a> The second partook more of the nature
of comedy than of tragedy. General Aizpuru, having
returned from Bogotá, whither he had gone as a senator
from Panamá, went off to Colon on the 7th of
June, and proclaimed himself provisional chief. That
same night Casorla was arrested near his residence,
and carried off to Colon, where he was held by the
revolutionary chief. The second designado, Jerardo
Ortega, then took charge of the executive.<a name='FA_XXVI-51' id='FA_XXVI-51' href='#FN_XXVI-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-51]</a> But

term, was inaugurated,<a name='FA_XXVI-52' id='FA_XXVI-52' href='#FN_XXVI-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-52]</a> his term of office being
two years.

The legislative assembly, June 13, 1881, passed a
law amending the constitution. Under this law the
assembly<a name='FA_XXVI-53' id='FA_XXVI-53' href='#FN_XXVI-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-53]</a> after 1882 was to meet on the 1st of October,
and within the first fifteen days of its ordinary
sittings count the votes for president of the state, and
for senators and representatives to the national congress.
Among other things, it was enacted that the
present assembly would name the substitutes of the
executive for the term to begin on the 1st of January,
1882. Cervera succeeded in maintaining order during
his term, though constantly disturbed with intrigues
of the most reprehensible character.

Rafael Nuñez, who had been declared the president
elect of the state,<a name='FA_XXVI-54' id='FA_XXVI-54' href='#FN_XXVI-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-54]</a> should have appeared to assume
the executive duties on the 1st of January, 1882, for
a term ending on the 31st of October, 1884; but as
he failed to do so, Dámaso Cervera, the first designado,
was summoned to take charge pro tempore of
the office.<a name='FA_XXVI-55' id='FA_XXVI-55' href='#FN_XXVI-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-55]</a> Nuñez resigned the position in November

PANAMÁ PRESIDENTS.
</p>

<p>
The election for president of the state for the next
term became a question upon which there was a disagreement
between the superior court during recess
of the legislative assembly, which decreed the election
should take place on the fourth Sunday of July, and
Cervera, who claimed that it ought not to be till the
following year. The latter proposition was acted
upon.<a name='FA_XXVI-58' id='FA_XXVI-58' href='#FN_XXVI-58' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-58]</a> Cervera obtained early in the year a month's
leave of absence, during which the executive office
was in charge of the second substitute, J. M. Vives
Leon, whose first act was to suppress the comandancia
general, and to muster out of service a number of
officers of all grades.<a name='FA_XXVI-59' id='FA_XXVI-59' href='#FN_XXVI-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-59]</a> The state was in constant
expectation of war, owing to affairs in other states,
and particularly to the presence of agents of the general
government having no recognized official position.
In the apprehension of political troubles, the states of
Panamá and Cauca entered into a convention<a name='FA_XXVI-60' id='FA_XXVI-60' href='#FN_XXVI-60' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-60]</a> to support
one another's interests in the expected contest.
Cervera thought, however, that the time was now
past when the national troops could interfere in the
internal affairs of the state.<a name='FA_XXVI-61' id='FA_XXVI-61' href='#FN_XXVI-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-61]</a>
</p>

<p>
The presence of federal forces on the Isthmus had
often been a source of danger to the state government.
But it was required by international obligation, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_546' name='Page_546' href='#Page_546'>546</a></span>
its necessity could but be recognized in view of the
fact that the construction of the interoceanic canal,
already under way, demanded the employment of thousands
of men from all parts of the world, who in the
event of strikes or for other causes might commit outrages.<a name='FA_XXVI-62' id='FA_XXVI-62' href='#FN_XXVI-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-62]</a>
The election of senators and representatives
to the national congress was effected this year by the
legislature, Dámaso Cervera, Ricardo Nuñez, and
José C. de Obaldía being chosen to the former position.<a name='FA_XXVI-63' id='FA_XXVI-63' href='#FN_XXVI-63' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-63]</a>
Cervera having been also elected first designado
of the presidency for 1884, he again was placed in
possession of the chief magistracy of the state on the
1st of January.<a name='FA_XXVI-64' id='FA_XXVI-64' href='#FN_XXVI-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-64]</a>
</p>

<p>
An abortive attempt was made, at the instigation
of Cervera's political enemies, to have him removed.
One of the justices of the superior court, on the 2d
of July, impeached and suspended him from office.
General Benjamin Ruiz, as second designado, was accordingly
handed the reins of government. But Cervera
resisted, and appealed to General Wenceslao
Ibañez, commanding the national brigade, to support
his authority. Meantime, the superior court by a
majority decided on the 6th that Plaza's decree should
have no effect, and that Ruiz had illegally assumed
the president's functions.<a name='FA_XXVI-65' id='FA_XXVI-65' href='#FN_XXVI-65' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-65]</a> Ibañez, however, on the
8th insisted on Cervera's leaving the government,
and himself took control, his troops besieging Cervera
in the state house. The latter then applied to the
superior court for a leave to proceed to Bogotá to
take his seat in the senate. Ruiz again seized the
presidency, and appointed B. Correoso secretary-general.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_547' name='Page_547' href='#Page_547'>547</a></span>
By some misunderstanding he was recognized
by the national executive. At this time, General
Eloi Porto, who ranked Ibañez, arrived in Panamá,
and through his good offices Cervera was replaced.<a name='FA_XXVI-66' id='FA_XXVI-66' href='#FN_XXVI-66' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-66]</a>
Ruiz might have been permitted to rule a while had
he followed in Cervera's footsteps; but he began to
remove prefects, and to despatch commissioners into
the interior, the peace of the state being again jeopardized,
which compelled Cervera to remain.

FIGHTING AT SEA.

<p>
A revolution broke out at David in the night of
September 19th, proclaiming a genuine suffrage, and
setting aside the declarations made by the judges of
election for president of the state and deputies to the
assembly. Movements of the same kind followed in
other parts. In the night of the 27th Cervera's
authority was pronounced in Panamá at an end, and
Ruiz was made the executive. Cervera on the 14th
of October proclaimed that public order had been disturbed
by Ruiz and his supporters,<a name='FA_XXVI-67' id='FA_XXVI-67' href='#FN_XXVI-67' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-67]</a> and established
martial law. An encounter between a government
force on board the steam-tug <i>Morro</i>, and another of

experienced damage and loss of crew.<a name='FA_XXVI-68' id='FA_XXVI-68' href='#FN_XXVI-68' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-68]</a> Cervera, who
was on board, was blamed for the repulse. The <i>Alajuela</i>
kept away a while, and then returned to land
some wounded men. The rebel chiefs, B. Ruiz, Gonzalez,
and Andreve, marched into the interior, respectively
to Veragua, Aguadulce, and Penonomé. This

of the national forces to arrest the guilty persons.<a name='FA_XXVI-69' id='FA_XXVI-69' href='#FN_XXVI-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-69]</a>
General Gónima, the federal commander, repaired to

lay down their arms, which he reported to Cervera on
the 2d of November.<a name='FA_XXVI-70' id='FA_XXVI-70' href='#FN_XXVI-70' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-70]</a>

The elections for president of the state took place
on the 27th of July, 1884. Juan Manuel Lambert
was chosen,<a name='FA_XXVI-71' id='FA_XXVI-71' href='#FN_XXVI-71' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-71]</a> and was recognized by the assembly in
October. But the intrigues of the liberal party, supported
by Gónima, deprived Lambert of his office.<a name='FA_XXVI-72' id='FA_XXVI-72' href='#FN_XXVI-72' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-72]</a>

<p>
On the 1st of October, upon the assembling of the
legislature, Cervera sent in his resignation; and no
notice having been taken, he reiterated it on the 20th,
reminding that body that it had enacted measures
which would necessitate his retaining power till the
end of December, when his term should cease on the
31st of October, and the president elect assume his
duties. The resignation was not accepted, and the
assembly on the 21st, by all the votes present, but
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_549' name='Page_549' href='#Page_549'>549</a></span>

The assembly had on the 14th of October passed
an act empowering the executive to call a convention
to be elected by direct popular vote on the 7th of

1885.<a name='FA_XXVI-74' id='FA_XXVI-74' href='#FN_XXVI-74' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-74]</a> The convention met on the appointed day.

he considered his position one that was by law untenable,

in view of the reasons adduced, accepted the resignation,

The Isthmus now becomes again the theatre of
deadly strife, with its concomitant bloodshed and
general destruction, to the disgrace of the nation of
which it forms a part, and the scandal of the world.
A plot by some men of the national force to seize the
revenue cutter <i>Boyacá</i> having been detected, thanks
to the loyalty of other members of the same force, the
executive notified the convention that the time had
come to proclaim martial law, which he did on the 9th
of February. The convention accordingly closed its
session on the 11th.<a name='FA_XXVI-82' id='FA_XXVI-82' href='#FN_XXVI-82' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-82]</a> On the 17th, Santodomingo
Vila obtained a leave of absence to proceed to Cartagena,
where his military services were required, and
Pablo Arosemena, the first designado, was summoned
to assume the executive authority.<a name='FA_XXVI-83' id='FA_XXVI-83' href='#FN_XXVI-83' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-83]</a> At about five
o'clock in the morning of the 16th of March the population
was awakened by the cries of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Vivan los liberales!</span>
Viva el general Aizpuru! accompanied with
numerous shots. Aizpuru, at the head of about 250
men, attacked the Cuartel de las Monjas, and the
tower of San Francisco, which were defended by a
handful of government troops, and a running fight
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_551' name='Page_551' href='#Page_551'>551</a></span>
from corner to corner ensued.<a name='FA_XXVI-84' id='FA_XXVI-84' href='#FN_XXVI-84' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-84]</a> The assailants overran
the city. The British war ship <i>Heroine</i> then
landed some marines and sailors to protect the railroad.
The president called for troops from Colon,
which came at once under General Gónima, and entering
the city early on the 17th, compelled the portion
of the revolutionists who had remained in the city to
rejoin their main body in the plains.<a name='FA_XXVI-85' id='FA_XXVI-85' href='#FN_XXVI-85' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-85]</a>

<p>
Upon the government troops leaving Colon, a
notorious man, Pedro Prestan,<a name='FA_XXVI-86' id='FA_XXVI-86' href='#FN_XXVI-86' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-86]</a> with a motley gang,
among whom were many of the worst characters,
seized the town,<a name='FA_XXVI-87' id='FA_XXVI-87' href='#FN_XXVI-87' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-87]</a> and sacked several merchants' houses,
demanding forced loans from such as were known to

he gave orders for the protection of foreigners and their
property.
</p>

<p>
The revolutionists under Aizpuru encamped at Farfan
refused to listen to any propositions. Their chief,
on the 24th of March, notified the foreign consuls of
his intention to assail the city of Panamá, which he
also made known to President Arosemena.<a name='FA_XXVI-89' id='FA_XXVI-89' href='#FN_XXVI-89' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-89]</a> This
functionary at once resigned his office into the hands

of the superior court, and sought safety on the British
ship <i>Heroine</i>. No other designado having been appointed
by the convention, General Gónima assumed
civil and military control, and appointed B. Correoso
his secretary-general. Another decree proclaimed the
neutrality of the state of Panamá in the war raging
in the rest of the republic. This proceeding restored
calm for a while, as it was taken to be the result
of an understanding between the revolutionists and
the government. But it seems to have become known
too late at the headquarters of Aizpuru and Prestan.<a name='FA_XXVI-90' id='FA_XXVI-90' href='#FN_XXVI-90' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-90]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the 29th of March the American mail steamer
<i>Colon</i> arrived at the port of the same name from New
York, and the government directed that she should
not deliver arms to the rebels. This gave rise to most
high-handed proceedings on the part of Prestan, culminating
in the arrest by his orders of the American
consul, Mr Wright, Captain Dow, general agent of
the steamship line, Connor, the local agent at Colon,
Lieutenant Judd and Cadet Midshipman Richardson,
of the United States war steamer <i>Galena</i>.<a name='FA_XXVI-91' id='FA_XXVI-91' href='#FN_XXVI-91' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-91]</a> Soon
afterward Richardson was released and sent on board
the <i>Galena</i> to tell his commander, Kane, that the other
prisoners would be kept in confinement till the arms
were surrendered, and if the <i>Galena</i> attempted to land
men, or to do any hostile act, the boats would be fired
upon, and every American citizen in the place would be
shot. Kane, knowing Prestan's character, did not attempt
any hasty act. Prestan then went to the prison
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_553' name='Page_553' href='#Page_553'>553</a></span>
and told Consul Wright that he must order Dow to
deliver the arms, or he would shoot the four prisoners
before that night. Wright complied, and they were
set at liberty.

<p>
But Kane took possession of the <i>Colon</i>, and in the
night landed a force and three pieces, under Lieutenant
Judd, with orders to release at all hazards Dow
and Connor, who had been again imprisoned.<a name='FA_XXVI-92' id='FA_XXVI-92' href='#FN_XXVI-92' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-92]</a> No

came on, driving the rebels before them into the intrenchments.
During the whole morning the firing
was kept up, and ended about 12, noon, when the
rebels being routed, Prestan and his rabble set fire to
the town at various places, and fled.<a name='FA_XXVI-94' id='FA_XXVI-94' href='#FN_XXVI-94' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-94]</a> A strong wind

But to return to Panamá. Aizpuru took advantage
of the situation, Gónima being left with only 60
soldiers, and a few civilians that had joined him, to
occupy the principal streets, on the 31st. To make the
story short, by 3 o'clock in the afternoon he was
master of the place, Gónima having surrendered.<a name='FA_XXVI-97' id='FA_XXVI-97' href='#FN_XXVI-97' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-97]</a>
Aizpuru announced in a proclamation on the 1st that
he had assumed the functions of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">jefe civil y militar</span>, to
which he had been called by the supporters of free
political principles, and on the 4th appointed his advisers,<a name='FA_XXVI-98' id='FA_XXVI-98' href='#FN_XXVI-98' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-98]</a>
and adopt measures to protect the city from
incendiarism, and specially to guard the interoceanic
transit. Marines and sailors having been landed on
the 8th of April from the United States frigate <i>Shenandoah</i>,
by Aizpuru's request, both ends of the Isthmus
were on the 10th guarded by American forces.
Soon after the United States sent reënforcements of
marines and sailors with special instructions to protect
the transit and American citizens and their interests,
avoiding all interference in the internal political squabbles.
Several war vessels of the U. S. home squadron,
under Rear-admiral Jouett, arrived at Colon.<a name='FA_XXVI-99' id='FA_XXVI-99' href='#FN_XXVI-99' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-99]</a> In
the night of the 24th of April, while the revolutionists
were erecting barricades, against an understanding
with the American commander, the marines under
Commander McCalla took possession of the city, as a
necessary measure to protect American property, and
Aizpuru and others were arrested. However, on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_555' name='Page_555' href='#Page_555'>555</a></span>
next day, Aizpuru having pledged himself not to raise
barricades or batteries, the prisoners were released,
and the Americans retired to their encampment outside.<a name='FA_XXVI-100' id='FA_XXVI-100' href='#FN_XXVI-100' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-100]</a>

<p class="sidenote">
RESULT OF COLUNJE'S SYSTEM.
</p>

<p>
On the 27th a well-equipped Colombian expedition
of about 850 men, under General Rafael Reyes,
arrived from Buenaventura to support M. Montoya
as civil and military chief of Panamá until a constitutional
government could be organized.<a name='FA_XXVI-101' id='FA_XXVI-101' href='#FN_XXVI-101' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-101]</a> With the
good offices of the foreign consuls, a peaceable arrangement
was entered into, by which Aizpuru bound
himself to disband his forces, deliver all arms, and
retire to private life.<a name='FA_XXVI-102' id='FA_XXVI-102' href='#FN_XXVI-102' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-102]</a> But having failed, as it was
alleged, as late as the 2d of May to surrender all the
rifles and caps in the hands of the rebels, he and others
were arrested and confined in the town hall.<a name='FA_XXVI-103' id='FA_XXVI-103' href='#FN_XXVI-103' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-103]</a> On
the 12th Aizpuru was sent to Buenaventura and held at
the disposal of the supreme government of Colombia.<a name='FA_XXVI-104' id='FA_XXVI-104' href='#FN_XXVI-104' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-104]</a>
It is understood that the rebel leaders were called
upon to pay large sums of money to meet the government's
necessarily increased expenditures; and that,
in order to secure payments, their property was
seized. This is the result of Colunje's system, which
Correoso followed. He has been now repaid in the
same coin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_556' name='Page_556' href='#Page_556'>556</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The Isthmus being now pacified, and 500 more Colombians
having arrived on the 9th of May, under
Colonel Dominguez, being another portion of Reyes'
force to relieve Santodomingo Vila at Cartagena, the
American marines, who had been expressly sent out
by their government, returned home, leaving a good
name for discipline and general good conduct.<a name='FA_XXVI-105' id='FA_XXVI-105' href='#FN_XXVI-105' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-105]</a> The
flagship <i>Tennessee</i> of Admiral Jouett, and the <i>Galena</i>,
Commander Kane, went to sea from Colon on the 11th
of May. The former conveyed General Reyes, with
relief for the Colombian government's troops at Cartagena.
</p>

<p>
After the death of President Olarte in 1868, the
Isthmus for many years did not enjoy a single day of
peace. The general wealth having declined throughout
the country, and more so in the interior, poverty
prevailed. Capital, both foreign and native, abandoned
so dangerous an abode. The cattle ranges and estates
disappeared; likewise agriculture, except on a small
scale.<a name='FA_XXVI-106' id='FA_XXVI-106' href='#FN_XXVI-106' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-106]</a>
</p>

<p>
The black men of the arrabal in the city of Panamá,
after they were made important factors in politics,
accustomed themselves to depend on the public funds
for a living, and the people of the interior, who were
always peaceable and industrious, came to be virtually
their tributaries. The state became the puppet of
the men at the head of the national government, or
of political clubs at Bogotá, whose agents incited disturbances,
removing presidents indisposed to coöperate
with or to meekly submit to their dictation, substituting
others favorable to their purposes, and thus
making themselves masters of the state government,
together with its funds, and with what is of no less
import, the state's vote in national elections.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SOCIETY AND POLITICS.
</p>

<p>
Since the establishment of the constitution of 1863,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_557' name='Page_557' href='#Page_557'>557</a></span>
Panamá has been considered a good field by men
aspiring to political and social position without risking
their persons and fortunes. They have ever found
unpatriotic Panameños ready to aid them in maintaining
the quondam colonial dependence, and investing
them with power, that they might grow fat together
on the spoils. Almost every national election, since
the great war of 1860, has brought about a forced
change in the state government. The first victim, as
we have seen, was Governor Guardia, deposed by national
troops under Santa Coloma. That was the beginning
of political demoralization on the Isthmus.
Every similar illegal device to insure party triumph
and power at Bogotá has been, I repeat, the work of
agents from the national capital assisted by men of
Panamá to push their own interests, and supported
by the federal garrison.<a name='FA_XXVI-107' id='FA_XXVI-107' href='#FN_XXVI-107' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-107]</a>
</p>

<p>
The office of chief magistrate is desired for controlling
political power, and the public funds to enrich the
holder and his chief supporters. Patriotism, and a
noble purpose to foster the welfare of the country and
the people in general, are, if thought of at all, objects
of secondary consideration. At times, the presidency
is fought for with arms among the negroes themselves,
and the city is then a witness of bloody scenes. The
aim of every such effort is to gain control of power for
the sake of the spoils.
</p>

<p>
Panamá cannot, being the smallest and weakest
state of the Colombian union, rid itself of the outside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_558' name='Page_558' href='#Page_558'>558</a></span>
pressure. Neither can it crush the unholy ambition
of its politicians. Both entail misfortunes enough.
But the Isthmus must also share the same sufferings
as the other states in times of political convulsion in
the whole nation.<a name='FA_XXVI-108' id='FA_XXVI-108' href='#FN_XXVI-108' class='fnanchor'>[XXVI-108]</a>
</p>

<p>
In view of the fact that the Isthmus of Panamá
may before many years become much more than
it has heretofore been, a great highway of nations,
and that the great interests which will be constantly
at stake on the route will demand an effectual protection,
it is self-evident that measures of a permanent
character must in time be adopted to secure that
end. Panamá, as an appendage of Colombia, and at
the mercy of an irresponsible population, cannot afford
that protection; neither is Colombia, with her constantly
recurring squabbles, better able to fulfil any
international obligations she might assume in the
premises. Without intending to cast any slur upon
her, or to doubt her honorable intentions, all—herself
among the number—must own that it would be
extremely dangerous to lean on so weak a reed. The
question therefore occurs, and must soon be solved,
What is to be the future status of the Isthmus? A
strong government is doubtless a necessity, and must
be provided from abroad. Shall it assume the form of
a quasi independent state under the protectorate of the
chief commercial nations, eliminating Colombia from
participation therein? or must the United States, as
the power most interested in preserving the independence
of the highway, take upon themselves the
whole control for the benefit of all nations? Time
will tell.

Since the foregoing remarks were written, a change
has taken place in the political organization of the
United States of Colombia, by which the government
has been centralized, the name of the republic
being changed to República de Colombia, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_559' name='Page_559' href='#Page_559'>559</a></span>

Central America proper embraces the region situated
between the state of Chiapas in the republic of
Mexico on the north, and the former state, now department,
of Panamá on the south, extending from
about latitude 7° to 18° north, in length from 800 to
900 miles, and in breadth varying from about 30 to
about 300 miles. The united area of the five republics
comprised therein is about 175,000 square miles.<a name='FA_XXVII-1' id='FA_XXVII-1' href='#FN_XXVII-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-1]</a>

<p>
The climate of this region on the Atlantic coast is
about the same as that of the West Indies, somewhat
modified by various causes. The Atlantic coast from
Trujillo downward, including the Mosquito region, is
low and insalubrious. That of the Pacific coast is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_561' name='Page_561' href='#Page_561'>561</a></span>
better in every respect, the heat not being so oppressive,
which is due to a drier and purer atmosphere.
The result is, that while the coasts on the Atlantic are
nearly uninhabited, those on the Pacific are lined
with towns and well settled.
</p>

<p>
Beginning with Guatemala, and going southward,
in Los Altos, the highlands of the republic, the average
temperature is lower than anywhere else. Snow
falls occasionally near Quezaltenango, but soon disappears.
The heat is never excessive.<a name='FA_XXVII-2' id='FA_XXVII-2' href='#FN_XXVII-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-2]</a> In the vicinity
of the city of Guatemala, the thermometer ranges
from 55° to 80° with an average of 72°. In Vera Paz,
the north-eastern department, it is nearly 10° warmer.
The whole coast from Belize down to Izabal and Santo
Tomás is hot and unhealthy.<a name='FA_XXVII-3' id='FA_XXVII-3' href='#FN_XXVII-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-3]</a> The state of Salvador,

but the heat is oppressive only at some points
on the coast.<a name='FA_XXVII-4' id='FA_XXVII-4' href='#FN_XXVII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-4]</a> Honduras has a fine climate, excepting

Segovia, which borders on Honduras and has the
same surface and temperature, has a topography and
climate of her own, with an average temperature in
the lake region of about 79° to 80°, due more to favorable
causes than to elevation. In Costa Rica there is
almost every degree of temperature, from the intensest
heat of Puntarenas to the constant spring of San
José, or the autumnal temperature of the belt above

NOTABLE CITIES.
</p>

<p>
The principal cities of the republic are Granada,
Managua, Masaya, Leon, Rivas, and Chinandega.
Managua was an insignificant town, but being situated
between Granada and Leon, was made the national
capital, in order that the government might be rid of
the complications arising from their constant rivalry,
and intrigues to control the destinies of Nicaragua.
The position of the capital is a splendid one, the surroundings
being very picturesque.<a name='FA_XXVII-26' id='FA_XXVII-26' href='#FN_XXVII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-26]</a> The streets are
not paved; the town has not a building worthy of
mention. The government house is a low, square edifice,
with balconies in the old Spanish style, without
any exterior ornamentation or architectural character,
Leon, the old capital, is situated on a beautiful plain,
and spreads over a very wide area.<a name='FA_XXVII-27' id='FA_XXVII-27' href='#FN_XXVII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-27]</a> In the central
part the streets are paved and lighted. There are
some fine buildings in the city, those most worthy of
notice being the cathedral, a strong piece of masonry,
often used as a fortress in times of civil war, the old
and new episcopal palaces, the university, government
house, two churches of greater architectural beauty
than the cathedral, four buildings which were formerly
convents, and now devoted to objects of public utility.
The place being in the region of earthquakes, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_569' name='Page_569' href='#Page_569'>569</a></span>
temperature extremely warm, the buildings are made
to meet these conditions. There is also a fine stone
bridge, which García Jerez had constructed. Near
Leon, and with only the width of a street from it, is
Subtiaba, which has a separate municipality, and whose
church is the largest, after the cathedral, and the oldest
of the temples in Nicaragua.<a name='FA_XXVII-28' id='FA_XXVII-28' href='#FN_XXVII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-28]</a> I give in a note

The republic of Honduras is bounded on the north
and east by the bay of Honduras and the Caribbean
Sea, extending from the mouth of the River Tinto to
the mouth of the Wanks or Segovia. On the south
it is bounded by Nicaragua—the line of division following
the Wanks for about two thirds of its length, and
thence deflecting to the south-west, to the sources of
the Rio Negro, flowing into the gulf of Fonseca; it has
a coast line of about sixty miles on this gulf from the
Rio Negro to the Rio Goascorán. On the west and
south-west are the republics of Salvador and Guatemala.<a name='FA_XXVII-30' id='FA_XXVII-30' href='#FN_XXVII-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-30]</a>

The republic is politically divided into seven departments:
Choluteca, Comayagua, Gracias, Olancho,
Santa Bárbara, Tegucigalpa, and Yoro. Nacaome is
the capital of Choluteca, and Jutecalpa of Olancho.
The other capitals bear the same names as the departments
to which they belong. The departments are

TOWNS AND HOUSES.
</p>

<p>
The principal cities in the republic are Comayagua,
anciently called Valladolid, the former capital, and
Tegucigalpa, the present seat of government. The
former is on the right bank of the Humuya or Ulúa
River, and on the southern border of the wide and
fertile valley of Comayagua. From its position, upwards
of 2,000 feet above the sea-level, surrounded
by high mountains, its temperative is mild and equable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_571' name='Page_571' href='#Page_571'>571</a></span>
The political disturbances of the country have
reduced Comayagua to a low condition,<a name='FA_XXVII-32' id='FA_XXVII-32' href='#FN_XXVII-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-32]</a> and the loss
of its standing as the capital has tended to bring it
down still lower. Most of the houses are of a single
story, and built of sundried bricks. The former fine
fountains, monuments, and public buildings have gone
to decay. The only building still in good condition
is the cathedral, which is a rather imposing edifice.<a name='FA_XXVII-33' id='FA_XXVII-33' href='#FN_XXVII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-33]</a>
Tegucigalpa enjoys a cool temperature, and has an
excellent climate. The city is the largest and finest
in the republic. It is built with regularity, and has
six churches, the parochial edifice comparing favorably
with the cathedral at Comayagua. There are
also a number of magnificent convents, and the university
also deserves mention.<a name='FA_XXVII-34' id='FA_XXVII-34' href='#FN_XXVII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-34]</a> There are other
places in the state not entirely devoid of interest, a

</p>

<p>
The republic of Salvador, the only one of Central
America not having a coast line on the Atlantic, is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_572' name='Page_572' href='#Page_572'>572</a></span>
bounded on the north and east by Honduras, on the
south-east by Fonseca Bay, on the south by the Pacific
Ocean, and on the north-west by Guatemala.<a name='FA_XXVII-36' id='FA_XXVII-36' href='#FN_XXVII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-36]</a> It possesses
the small islands called Punta Zacate, Martin
Perez, Conchagüita, and Mianguera in the bay of
Fonseca.
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of government the republic is
divided into fourteen departments; namely, San Salvador,
Cuscatlán, San Vicente, La Paz, Usulután,
San Miguel, Gotera,<a name='FA_XXVII-37' id='FA_XXVII-37' href='#FN_XXVII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-37]</a> La Union, Cabañas, Chalatenango,
Santa Ana, Ahuachapan, Sonsonate, and La
Libertad. The departments are subdivided into districts,
and the latter into cities, villas, pueblos, and
aldeas. The chief towns of the departments bear the
same names as the latter, excepting those of Cuscatlán,
La Paz, Gotera, La Union, Cabañas, and La
Libertad, which are respectively called Cojutepeque,
Zacatecoluca, Osicala, San Cárlos, Sensuntepeque,
and Nueva San Salvador. They all have the rank
of cities. Chinameca, Jucuapa, Ilobasco, Suchitoto,
Metapan, and Izalco enjoy the same distinction.
There are, besides, about 36 villas, and 176 pueblos.

<p class="sidenote">
MUNICIPAL REGULATIONS.
</p>

<p>
At the head of each department is placed a governor,
who has a substitute to fill the office in his absence,
both being appointed by the national executive for a
constitutional term. They may be impeached for
misdemeanors in office before the senate.<a name='FA_XXVII-38' id='FA_XXVII-38' href='#FN_XXVII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-38]</a> The alcaldes

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_573' name='Page_573' href='#Page_573'>573</a></span>
of their respective districts, and like the alcaldes of

event of absence or disability of an alcalde, the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">regidor

are represented in distant country places by
<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">comisionados</span> of their own appointment. Each town
has for its internal management a municipal corporation

consisting of one alcalde, one síndico, and from two to
six regidores, according to population.<a name='FA_XXVII-39' id='FA_XXVII-39' href='#FN_XXVII-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-39]</a> Such corporations

</p>

<p>
The principal cities are San Salvador, San Miguel,
Santa Ana, which has been the capital, Cojutepeque,
which has also been the seat of government, Sonsonate,
Zacatecoluca, San Vicente, Sensuntepeque, Chalatenango,
Santa Rosa, Ahuachapán, and Santa Tecla
or Nueva San Salvador.
</p>

<p>
San Salvador was first founded at a place now called
Bermuda, about eighteen miles to the northward of
the present site. During the Spanish domination it
was the residence of the gobernador intendente. After
the separation from the Spanish crown it became the
capital of Salvador, and for a while was the federal
district, and seat of the Central American government.
The city, as I have stated elsewhere, has been repeatedly
shattered by earthquakes, but in each instance
rebuilt, notwithstanding efforts to abandon the site.
Both the town and its position are beautiful. It is
in the midst of a broad elevated plateau in the coast
range, between the valley of the Lempa River and
the Pacific Ocean, 2,115 feet above the sea.<a name='FA_XXVII-41' id='FA_XXVII-41' href='#FN_XXVII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-41]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_574' name='Page_574' href='#Page_574'>574</a></span>
place has a cathedral, and other churches, a national
palace, a university, and other government buildings.
Excepting the central and paved park, San Salvador
is embowered in tropical fruit-trees.
</p>

<p>
San Miguel is justly considered the second city of
Salvador. Its houses have a home aspect, comfort in
the interior, and elegance in the exterior. It is supplied
with water by an aqueduct. There are fountains
to refresh the air and to please the eye. Two
iron bridges cross the San Miguel River, said to have
been constructed by Guzman at an expense of $90,000
of his own money. Back of the town is the majestic
volcano of San Miguel. In the bay of Fonseca is the
excellent port of La Union, to the west that of La
Libertad, and beyond that of Acajutla at a short
distance from Sonsonate and the Izalco volcano.

Sololá, Totonicapan, Quiché, Quezaltenango, Retalhuleu,
Suchitepéquez, Huehuetenango, San Márcos,

or amendment by the supreme government. At the
head of each department is a jefe politico, and some of
them likewise have a sub-jefe.
</p>

<p>
The general government makes its administrative
action felt in the departments. Down to 1879 the
laws relating to civil administration in them were not
only confused, but contained clauses which were,
some of them, opposed to the principles of modern
legislation, and others directly contrary to the liberal

Guatemala, the capital, together with the whole republic,
has had its beauties more or less extolled by
every foreign traveller who has visited it and published
a book, from 1822 to late years. These praises
were well deserved; but they fall short of what they
now should be, considering the improvements introduced
by the energetic administration of President
Barrios, which placed it on a level with many cities
of greater pretensions and resources.<a name='FA_XXVII-48' id='FA_XXVII-48' href='#FN_XXVII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-48]</a>

The city stands about 5,300 feet above the sea,
upon a fertile plateau traversed by the Rio de las
Vacas, being almost surrounded by ravines. It is
laid out in wide, regular, well-paved, and clean streets,
forming right angles, and has extensive suburbs. The
number of houses is probably 5,000, most of them of
one story. There is, however, a considerable number
with two stories. They are mostly constructed with
solidity and comfort, and many have fountains, gardens,
and courts.<a name='FA_XXVII-49' id='FA_XXVII-49' href='#FN_XXVII-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-49]</a> Besides the cathedral, archepiscopal
palace, government house, mint, and other public

the city by aqueducts from a distance of several miles.<a name='FA_XXVII-51' id='FA_XXVII-51' href='#FN_XXVII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-51]</a>
Most of the houses also have wells. The city is likewise

BUILDINGS AND POPULATION.
</p>

<p>
The city of Panamá is laid out with regularity, on
a rocky peninsula, presenting a fine appearance from
the sea, as it stands out from the dark hills inland
with an air of grandeur. The Ancona hill 540 feet
high rising a mile westward of the city—helps to render
the place conspicuous. But on entering, the visitor
finds himself disappointed. The principal streets
cross the peninsula from sea to sea, intersected by the
Calle Real, running east and west. The place has a
quiet and stately appearance, without promising comfort.
The houses are mostly of stone built in the
Spanish style, the larger ones having heavy balconies
in the upper stories, with court-yards or patios. There
is little relief or variety.<a name='FA_XXVII-59' id='FA_XXVII-59' href='#FN_XXVII-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-59]</a> The smaller ones are of
a single story. The churches and public buildings,
namely, the cathedral, casa de la gobernacion, cabildo or
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_579' name='Page_579' href='#Page_579'>579</a></span>
town hall, ecclesiastical seminary, and four convents for
friars and one for nuns, were strongly built; but years
of neglect and the deteriorating effects of the climate
have brought many of them to decay; notwithstanding
which some of the ecclesiastical edifices are still
used for the service of God, whilst others, not utterly
ruined, are applied to other purposes.<a name='FA_XXVII-60' id='FA_XXVII-60' href='#FN_XXVII-60' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-60]</a> The place was
at one time tolerably well fortified, but the fortifications
no longer exist; the south and west ramparts
are, however, in good condition forming an agreeable
promenade. The drainage is very bad; many necessary
things to insure cleanliness and comfort are wanting;
good potable water being scarce and high-priced.<a name='FA_XXVII-61' id='FA_XXVII-61' href='#FN_XXVII-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-61]</a>
The city has enjoyed the benefit of gas light for several
years past, and since the construction of the canal
was begun, it has had many improvements introduced,
among them a fine and spacious hospital.<a name='FA_XXVII-62' id='FA_XXVII-62' href='#FN_XXVII-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-62]</a>

<p>
The place next in importance on the Isthmus is
Colon, otherwise known as Aspinwall, on the island
of Manzanilla. It is the Atlantic port of the Isthmus,
and contains the stations, offices, and wharf of the
railway company, as well as those of the several
steam-ship companies, and likewise a number of buildings
of the ship-canal enterprise. The town was progressing
rapidly, and had a number of fine modern
buildings other than those before mentioned, but it
was ruined by the vandalic act of revolutionists, which
event has been elsewhere described in this volume.<a name='FA_XXVII-63' id='FA_XXVII-63' href='#FN_XXVII-63' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-63]</a>

The official census of population in the Isthmus of
Panamá for 1880 showed the number of inhabitants
to have been 307,598.<a name='FA_XXVII-64' id='FA_XXVII-64' href='#FN_XXVII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-64]</a> The report laid by the state
government before the assembly in September 1882
stated that the population had increased since 1880 to
343,782, which was due to the influx of men employed
on the canal-works. There have been many fluctuations
since. The proportion of negroes and mixed
breeds has ever been larger than the pure whites in
the city of Panamá and on the Caribbean Sea coast,
and after the opening of the canal-works it became
greatly increased with laborers from the coast to the
south, Jamaica, etc., almost all being negroes. In
the interior departments the case is quite different,
the majority of the inhabitants being of pure whites.

Efforts made from time to time to develop foreign
colonization through land grants have never led to

In 1873, a law was enacted to compel the wild

<p>
There are but few families of the higher class in
Panamá, and time is required to establish a footing of
intimacy with them. Considerable has been said in
Europe against the character of the women of Panamá,
which is not borne out by fact. Much real worth
exists among them. Indeed, the native women of the
Isthmus generally, possess the best qualifications.
They are not only pretty, graceful, and refined, but
are dutiful daughters, and excellent wives and mothers.
Those in the higher positions, even while laboring
under the disadvantage of a limited education, which
during a long time was the case with a majority of
them, have, as a rule, been of industrious and economical
habits. In later years the young girls of the better
class have been enabled to acquire an education. The
same cannot be said of the women of the lower classes,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_582' name='Page_582' href='#Page_582'>582</a></span>
whose moral scale is quite low, marriage with them
being the exception rather than the rule. For this
state of things the upper class is partly responsible,
inasmuch as from a misguided feeling of charity it looks
upon the practice with indifference instead of frowning
upon it.<a name='FA_XXVII-70' id='FA_XXVII-70' href='#FN_XXVII-70' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-70]</a>
</p>

<p>
The women of Panamá, since the early days of railway
travelling, have abandoned their former ways of
dressing and of arranging their beautiful hair, adopting
European fashions and putting on hats. The
women of the lower order, till very recently, wore the
polleras;<a name='FA_XXVII-71' id='FA_XXVII-71' href='#FN_XXVII-71' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-71]</a> but this is becoming a thing of the past.
These women are very untidy; they move about their
houses slipshod and stockingless. The dress of the
native laboring man is a pair of cotton or linen trousers
and a shirt.
</p>

<p>
The young men of the educated class are well-mannered,
and most of them have an average share of
ability, but application and steadiness of purpose are
wanting. Like their sisters, they are kind and affectionate
to their families and relatives.<a name='FA_XXVII-72' id='FA_XXVII-72' href='#FN_XXVII-72' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-72]</a> Nearly all
the male inhabitants speak English as well as their
native language, and a number, who have been abroad,
are conversant with French and even German.
</p>

<p>
In their domestic life, notwithstanding their constant
intercourse with people of other nations, the
Panamanians keep themselves secluded, much as they
did before the railway was constructed. They still
hug a portion of their old opinions and prejudices.
Nevertheless, the fullest liberty of conscience and of
religion being recognized by the Colombian laws, all
forms of worship may be publicly practised.<a name='FA_XXVII-73' id='FA_XXVII-73' href='#FN_XXVII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-73]</a>

EDUCATION.
</p>

<p>
The government of Panamá has not always manifested
a proper interest in the diffusion of knowledge
among the masses. It must be acknowledged, however,
that during the existence of the central régime,
prior to 1860, the children throughout the Isthmus
had a better opportunity to acquire instruction, there
being schools with paid teachers in nearly all the
towns.<a name='FA_XXVII-74' id='FA_XXVII-74' href='#FN_XXVII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-74]</a> After the revolutionary period became inaugurated,
the funds of the government hardly ever satisfied
the greed of political leaders, or sufficed to meet
the cost of a large military force, and public instruction
suffered. This occurred more particularly in the
interior, and even the capital has seen its public
schools closed for the want of funds.<a name='FA_XXVII-75' id='FA_XXVII-75' href='#FN_XXVII-75' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-75]</a> The legislators
in 1871 gave a new organization to this branch of the
public service, but for various reasons nothing was
accomplished until 1873, when the philanthropic
Manuel J. Hurtado undertook the task of getting
some light out of the existing chaos. His efforts soon
began to yield good results, though more satisfactory
ones might have been obtained had the state government
afforded larger means.<a name='FA_XXVII-76' id='FA_XXVII-76' href='#FN_XXVII-76' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-76]</a> Normal schools have
been also established for training teachers, and several
other educational institutes have been founded, one for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_584' name='Page_584' href='#Page_584'>584</a></span>
females under women of a religious order. Nevertheless,
the majority of young men possessed of means
go abroad or to Bogotá to complete their education.
</p>

<p>
The Isthmus has not produced any notable literary
or scientific men, properly so-called, though there are
and have been among its people bright intellects. In
political and diplomatic life, however, may be mentioned
as notabilities Justo Arosemena, José Obaldía,
Pablo Arosemena, and Jil Colunje.
</p>

<p>
The newspaper press has been during many years
represented on the Isthmus by the <i>Star and Herald</i>,<a name='FA_XXVII-77' id='FA_XXVII-77' href='#FN_XXVII-77' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-77]</a>
which is the vehicle for the communication of news
between Europe and the United States on the one
side, and the countries in Central and South America
on the other. It has been for many years, and continues
to be, entitled to rank as a first-class newspaper.
Its local edition now appears daily in English, Spanish,
and French; the edition for Europe and the
United States, to leave by each departing steamer, is
in English; and the one for Central and South
America is in Spanish, the publication then bearing
the name of <i>La Estrella</i>.<a name='FA_XXVII-78' id='FA_XXVII-78' href='#FN_XXVII-78' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-78]</a> Several other newspapers
have been published, besides the official organ, from
time to time in English and Spanish, or wholly in

Few, if any, precautions are taken to improve the
sanitary condition of the capital, and much less of any
other town. In fact, any partial efforts will be of little
avail so long as drainage is so bad, and the habits
of the lower classes continue so filthy. The necessity
of sanitary measures is generally admitted, and ordinances
have been enacted to that effect;<a name='FA_XXVII-87' id='FA_XXVII-87' href='#FN_XXVII-87' class='fnanchor'>[XXVII-87]</a> but their

COLONIZATION COMPANIES.
</p>

<p>
The republic of Central America, as well as the
several states that formed it, has from the earliest
days of its national autonomy endeavored to encourage
foreign immigration, offering inducements,
such as liberal grants of land, exemption from taxes
and military service, and the privileges of citizenship.
At the same time care has been had to respect the
property and other rights of foreigners. Colonization
decrees were passed in 1831, 1834, and 1836,<a name='FA_XXVIII-4' id='FA_XXVIII-4' href='#FN_XXVIII-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-4]</a> the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_589' name='Page_589' href='#Page_589'>589</a></span>
legislators feeling as sanguine of good results as they
were earnest and sincere in their purpose. An
English company, called the Eastern Coast of Central
America Commercial and Agricultural Company,
organized in London, was the first to enter the field,
having obtained from the state of Guatemala a grant
of land which included the whole department of Vera
Paz.<a name='FA_XXVIII-5' id='FA_XXVIII-5' href='#FN_XXVIII-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-5]</a> Dishonesty presided over the operations of the
company.<a name='FA_XXVIII-6' id='FA_XXVIII-6' href='#FN_XXVIII-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-6]</a> About 300 persons, many of them from
the refuse of the population of London, were sent
out, without proper preparations or knowledge of the
country, to places in or near the hot and insalubrious
coasts, where the unhappy creatures wandered, suffered,
and almost all perished. Meanwhile, the
directors of the company labored in vain to induce
the British government to sanction their proceedings.<a name='FA_XXVIII-7' id='FA_XXVIII-7' href='#FN_XXVIII-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-7]</a>
The whole project ultimately failed, the directors
being in their turn deceived by the men in whom they
had reposed most confidence. After wasting many
lives, and misappropriating some £40,000, lost of
course by the share-holders, the charter became forfeited
for non-fulfilment of its terms.<a name='FA_XXVIII-8' id='FA_XXVIII-8' href='#FN_XXVIII-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Another colonization scheme was started in May
1842, and ratified in a further convention of October
1843, between a Belgian company established in
Brussels, and the government of Guatemala.<a name='FA_XXVIII-9' id='FA_XXVIII-9' href='#FN_XXVIII-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-9]</a> The
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_590' name='Page_590' href='#Page_590'>590</a></span>
company, under that contract, assumed the obligation
of introducing at least 100 families of five members
each, annually, till 1,000 families had been settled.
The colonists were to be catholics, and from the
moment of their landing were to be considered Guatemalan
citizens, with all the rights and duties of such.<a name='FA_XXVIII-10' id='FA_XXVIII-10' href='#FN_XXVIII-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-10]</a>
</p>

<p>
All the articles of the agreement were most favorable
to Guatemala, and yet the company, which was
under the patronage of the king of the Belgians, signed
it without his approval being first obtained. It is
known that his government disapproved many parts
of it. It would seem as if the Belgians were bent on
getting possession of the district on any terms, hoping
afterward to retain it by negotiation as a Belgian colony.
The company fulfilled the conditions for the
first two years, but the great mortality of colonists at
Santo Tomás made it impossible to induce others to
emigrate; and though the Belgian government rendered
pecuniary aid to the amount of $200,000, the
settlement shared the fate of the one attempted by
the British in 1836. The company was dissolved,
and the government of Guatemala resumed possession
of the district, including the port of Santo Tomás.<a name='FA_XXVIII-11' id='FA_XXVIII-11' href='#FN_XXVIII-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-11]</a>

to introduce 10,000 immigrants from Europe or the

the country by the discovery of valuable gold placers.<a name='FA_XXVIII-15' id='FA_XXVIII-15' href='#FN_XXVIII-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-15]</a>

Salvador has done little or nothing toward increasing
her population by immigration; but foreigners of
good moral character and industrious habits are always
welcomed and protected in their rights. They can also
become naturalized after five years' residence, or at the
end of three years by contracting marriage with a native
of the state.

which had no effect.

Still another concession was made May 7, 1852, to
a German company, organized at Berlin, who seemed
to be actuated by a desire to carry out their obligations,

their scheme with disfavor.<a name='FA_XXVIII-27' id='FA_XXVIII-27' href='#FN_XXVIII-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-27]</a> Baron Bülow was the

director of the company. He died in 1856, and in all
probability his enterprise died with him. Another
attempt was made by Crisanto Medina, to whom a
large grant of land was made for colonization purposes,
at Miravalles, at the foot of the volcano of that
name. The grant embraced a fine plateau about
2,500 feet above the sea.<a name='FA_XXVIII-28' id='FA_XXVIII-28' href='#FN_XXVIII-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-28]</a> In 1852 thirty-seven

CLASS DISTINCTIONS.
</p>

<p>
The most numerous class of population in Central
America, next to the pure Indians, are the ladinos,
most of whom are half-breeds, which include the mestizos,
mulattoes, quadroons, octoroons, and zambos.<a name='FA_XXVIII-33' id='FA_XXVIII-33' href='#FN_XXVIII-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-33]</a>
The mestizos are of a light yellow hue; numbers of
them, however, are found as white as the natives of
southern Europe. They are generally a fine-looking
race of men, resembling in bodily and mental features
the creoles or pure native whites, though more hardy.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_595' name='Page_595' href='#Page_595'>595</a></span>
In temperament they are passionate, revengeful, treacherous,
and cowardly, ambitious and yet lazy, sensuous,
and in a majority of cases, at least in the lower class,
devoid of moral principle. The pure Indian is more
reliable than the mestizo, the latter having all the vices
of the two races out of which he sprang.
</p>

<p>
The ladino class furnishes the domestic servants,
muleteers, small farmers and tenants, herdsmen, and
not a few beggars and robbers. In revolutionary
times many of its numbers have been banditti, preying,
under the garb of guerillamen, upon both friend and
foe. A considerable number of ladinos, however, become
mechanics and traders, and many have attained
high positions in the church and the state, and become
distinguished for their talents and abilities.<a name='FA_XXVIII-34' id='FA_XXVIII-34' href='#FN_XXVIII-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-34]</a> The
zambos and other mixtures of the negro race, like most
of the negroes and mulattoes, reside in the coast districts.
They do the heaviest work in the towns, and
often engage in agriculture.
</p>

<p>
The Creoles, or pure native whites, calling themselves
Americans, though less numerous, form the
ruling class. In the towns they are the leading element,
filling the most desirable positions, such as those
of land and mine owners, merchants, manufacturers,
lawyers, physicians, mechanics, officials, and higher
clergy.<a name='FA_XXVIII-35' id='FA_XXVIII-35' href='#FN_XXVIII-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-35]</a> The creole is generally well built, and of
about medium height, with a pleasing expression of
countenance. His eyes are usually black like his hair
and beard. He lacks the steadfastness of the Anglo-Saxon,
and the trustworthiness of the German, often
allowing himself to be swayed by passion and caprice.
There are, nevertheless, many honorable exceptions,
which are probably the result of education and contact
with the people of other and older nations. Indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_596' name='Page_596' href='#Page_596'>596</a></span>
whatever may have been the defects of character of
the creole, when he lived comparatively isolated from
the world, and entertained the conceit of his own excellence
and superiority, a great change for the better
is noticeable in many individuals in after years, since
Central America has been enjoying facilities of communication
with other peoples, which has enabled her
sons and daughters to study their ways, and to adopt
whatever is good in them, not to mention the bad
ways which have also taken root.

<p class="p2">
The population of Costa Rica is represented to be
nearly all white, the Indians not being numerous, and
the negroes and mixed breeds living on the coast.<a name='FA_XXVIII-36' id='FA_XXVIII-36' href='#FN_XXVIII-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-36]</a>
The Costa Ricans are a well-formed people. There
is, perhaps, not as much manly dignity and female
grace as are yet to be found in Spain; nor is the color
of their females, as a rule, to be compared with that
of their European sisters; but what is lacking in that
is fully compensated by elegance of form, regularity of
features, splendid eyes, and an abundance of glossy
hair,<a name='FA_XXVIII-37' id='FA_XXVIII-37' href='#FN_XXVIII-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-37]</a> and not least by their affability and sweetness
of manner. The people are generally intelligent, and
noted for the absence of hauteur in their manner.<a name='FA_XXVIII-38' id='FA_XXVIII-38' href='#FN_XXVIII-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-38]</a>

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_597' name='Page_597' href='#Page_597'>597</a></span>
and peaceable. Upon occasions they have shown
themselves possessed of good soldierly qualities when
their independence or rights have been in peril, as
during Walker's filibuster war; but they cannot be
called a warlike people.<a name='FA_XXVIII-40' id='FA_XXVIII-40' href='#FN_XXVIII-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-40]</a> They are not ambitious,
aspiring to a moderate independence to be attained
without an excessive effort. Indigence is almost unknown.
All Costa Ricans own property of some kind,
and even the humblest of them has the ambition of
possessing a piece of land.

DOMESTIC AFFAIRS
</p>

<p>
The houses of the wealthy and well-to-do are quite
comfortable. They are built with ordinary doors and
windows, and of one or two stories.<a name='FA_XXVIII-41' id='FA_XXVIII-41' href='#FN_XXVIII-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-41]</a> Window-glass
is only used in the better houses of the principal cities.
In the smaller towns windows are dispensed with as
superfluous. Carpets are to be found in a few houses
of the wealthy, or of foreigners. Instead of them,
floors are covered with matting. The rich exhibit
paintings or engravings on their walls. The houses
of the poor are comfortless.<a name='FA_XXVIII-42' id='FA_XXVIII-42' href='#FN_XXVIII-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-42]</a>
</p>

<p>
The higher classes enjoy the pleasures of the table.
In the populous cities inns are kept for the better
class of travellers, at which a tolerably good table is
provided. The usual food of the peasants and other
poor people consists of tasajo, or jerked beef, black
beans, corn, rice, tortillas, plantains, and other fruits.<a name='FA_XXVIII-43' id='FA_XXVIII-43' href='#FN_XXVIII-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-43]</a>
Intoxication is prevalent among the lower classes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_598' name='Page_598' href='#Page_598'>598</a></span>
Guaro, or aguardiente, and gin are deemed a necessity
for the peasant and laborer. With the action of the
heat and the poor food, liquor soon overpowers him.<a name='FA_XXVIII-44' id='FA_XXVIII-44' href='#FN_XXVIII-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
Saturday is the day upon which the cities are supplied
with comestibles and other commodities for the
week. Natives of both sexes and all ages throng the
market-places, particularly in San José,<a name='FA_XXVIII-45' id='FA_XXVIII-45' href='#FN_XXVIII-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-45]</a> bringing
vegetables, fruits, and other food for the table. Others
bring manufactured articles, like earthen-ware, hammocks,
charcoal, hats, rebozos, etc.<a name='FA_XXVIII-46' id='FA_XXVIII-46' href='#FN_XXVIII-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-46]</a> From sunrise
till noon the market-places are crammed with sellers
and buyers. The ladies of all ranks do their own
marketing, and are seen, basket on arm and bareheaded,
strolling about and driving bargains. The
market-women move rapidly, carrying goods on their
heads or in strings. The better class of women follow
in their dress the fashions of Europe, except that they
wear no hats. The females of the lower classes have
their own mode of dress, which is generally more
studied than in other places of Central America.
Some of them wear ear-rings and expensive collars, a
jipijapa hat costing $16. The gowns are of muslin,
printed calico, or some other light material, and cover
half a dozen embroidered petticoats. The hair is divided
into two tresses hanging down behind, and in the
braids runs a bright-colored ribbon. Others wear on
the head a rebozo, which like the hat is significant of
the taste or wealth of the wearer.<a name='FA_XXVIII-47' id='FA_XXVIII-47' href='#FN_XXVIII-47' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-47]</a> Only a few among
them complete this studied toilet with shoes or boots.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_599' name='Page_599' href='#Page_599'>599</a></span>
The men bring their mules, or carts, or merely their
machetes. They generally wear a coarse cloth coat
and a pair of drill or cotton trousers. The hat varies;
it is either of straw, otter, or felt. Most of the people
of the interior go barefooted, but carry plenty of
pesos in their pockets and make them jingle. After
purchasing in the market-place such articles as they
need, which go under the general term habilitaciones,
and selling their products, they seek the vinaterías or
pulperías, and invite one another to drink.

The great amusement of Costa Rica is gambling.
The people have a command of money, and their only
ways of spending it, to afford them entertainment, are
the church, the bottle, and gambling.<a name='FA_XXVIII-48' id='FA_XXVIII-48' href='#FN_XXVIII-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-48]</a> On Sundays

<p class="sidenote">NICARAGUAN SOCIETY.</p>

<p class="p2">
The Nicaraguan women of pure Spanish stock are
quite fair, and have the embonpoint characterizing the
sex under the tropics. Many of them are handsome,
having an oval face, regular features, large and lustrous
black eyes, small mouth, good teeth, small hands
and feet; and withal a low but clear voice. Some of
the descendants of white and Indian of the higher
class are also quite beautiful. The Indian girl with
her full lithe figure, long glossy hair, and erect walk
should not be overlooked.<a name='FA_XXVIII-51' id='FA_XXVIII-51' href='#FN_XXVIII-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-51]</a> Nicaraguan society has
a peculiar charm and grace, with little conventionality.
Both men and women of all classes are extremely courteous.<a name='FA_XXVIII-52' id='FA_XXVIII-52' href='#FN_XXVIII-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-52]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_600' name='Page_600' href='#Page_600'>600</a></span>
Strangers are well received, if decently clad,
well-mannered, and of good behavior. They will find
it rather difficult to obtain the privilege of visiting respectable
families. When a young man desires to
pay his addresses to a young lady, he applies for the
permission of her parents, guardian, or relations, as
the case may be. Marriages are invariably according
to the rites of the catholic church. Burials of members
of rich families are in churches.<a name='FA_XXVIII-53' id='FA_XXVIII-53' href='#FN_XXVIII-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-53]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Nicaraguans of the higher order—there is no
middle one—cannot be credited with industrious
habits. Life is easy with them, and the climate is
enervating. So they spend much of their time lying
in a hammock and smoking cigarettes.<a name='FA_XXVIII-54' id='FA_XXVIII-54' href='#FN_XXVIII-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-54]</a> The lower
order in the towns follow the example, at least the
male portion. The peasantry, however, is docile and
fairly industrious, and may be called an excellent rural
population. The peon system is unknown in Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
The Nicaraguan people have a fine muscular development,
and a mild soft expression. Though not warlike,
they are brave, and will fight desperately when
reduced to it by necessity. The masses are not so
demoralized as some travellers would have us believe
them. Crimes are relatively rare, and the public
roads are safe from highwaymen.<a name='FA_XXVIII-55' id='FA_XXVIII-55' href='#FN_XXVIII-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-55]</a> A servant may
steal a small amount, or some object thrown in his
way, and yet will convey a large sum of money to a

it. It must be confessed that there is too much

<p class="sidenote">
DRESS AND DWELLINGS.
</p>

<p>
There is no national costume. The wealthy follow
to some extent to European fashions, generally suppressing
the silk hat, which is replaced with any
hat that is broad-brimmed and suited to the climate.<a name='FA_XXVIII-57' id='FA_XXVIII-57' href='#FN_XXVIII-57' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-57]</a>
Men of the lower class go barefooted, or wear the
caite, which is a species of sandal. The rest of their
dress is a pair of cotton trousers, frequently not reaching
lower than the knees, a shirt, its lower part often
outside the trousers, and a palm-leaf hat.
</p>

<p>
There are many fine horsemen in Nicaragua, as
well as in all Central America. A caballero is in his
element when mounted on a spirited, champing horse,
with a pellon thrown over the saddle, which is the
Mexican saddle modified and with high peaks. He
carries also to complete his equipment a pair of bolsters
and pistols.<a name='FA_XXVIII-58' id='FA_XXVIII-58' href='#FN_XXVIII-58' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-58]</a> Women imitate the European summer
costumes, but use no hat except when riding on
horseback. They generally appear in a loose and
flowing dress, with neck and arms exposed. A light
shawl is thrown over the shoulders, or worn over the
head at church. A red or purple sash may be wound
around the waist, and a narrow golden band, or a
string of pearls extending around the forehead and
binding the hair, which often falls in luxuriant waves
over the shoulders. The usual way of dressing the
hair is to have two braids knotted behind the head,
and to place a few natural flowers in it. The feet are
incased in satin slippers. The women of the lower
class use a petticoat without waist, covering the undergarments.
A floating short shirt quite open in the
upper part, and almost sleeveless hardly concealing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_602' name='Page_602' href='#Page_602'>602</a></span>
the bust. In the street they wrap themselves in a
rebozo. Stockings and shoes are worn only in cities.<a name='FA_XXVIII-59' id='FA_XXVIII-59' href='#FN_XXVIII-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-59]</a>
</p>

<p>
The dwellings of the poor in the country are usually
of canes thatched with palms, many of them
open at the sides, and with the bare earth for floors.
Some of them have the canes plastered over, and
whitewashed, with tile roofs, or otherwise improved.
Those of large proprietors are strongly built, neat,
comfortable, and generally cool. In the towns there
are many dwellings of the same character; but the
residences of the wealthier class are built of adobes,
of one story, enclosing large courts which are entered
under archways, these being frequently constructed
with much beauty.<a name='FA_XXVIII-60' id='FA_XXVIII-60' href='#FN_XXVIII-60' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-60]</a> The interior is divided into
large rooms around the gallery or corridor. The walls
are whitened on both sides. One of the rooms is
used as a parlor, the others for different purposes.<a name='FA_XXVIII-61' id='FA_XXVIII-61' href='#FN_XXVIII-61' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-61]</a>
The furniture is generally of home manufacture and
simple enough.<a name='FA_XXVIII-62' id='FA_XXVIII-62' href='#FN_XXVIII-62' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-62]</a> The house is lighted with stearine
candles, imported or common tallow dips. Petroleum

FOOD AND DRINK.

The characteristics of Nicaraguan life are sobriety
and uniformity of food.<a name='FA_XXVIII-64' id='FA_XXVIII-64' href='#FN_XXVIII-64' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-64]</a> Families make a practice
of not laying in supplies, but purchase what they need

<p>
The custom of extending invitations to dinner with
one's family, so common in other countries, does not
obtain in Nicaragua, except among relatives or very
intimate friends. Men are asked to eat only on special
occasions, when banquets are given, at which the
English custom of giving toasts is followed.
</p>

<p>
Amusements are few in Nicaragua. However, the
upper classes have their tertulias and balls, often improvised,
at which the polka, waltz, bolero, and other
well-known Spanish dances are performed with grace
and spirit. The lower classes frequently have fandangoes
and other characteristic dances. There is no
place of general resort for the better classes, unless it
is the billiard-room, which serves alike as a gambling-den.<a name='FA_XXVIII-65' id='FA_XXVIII-65' href='#FN_XXVIII-65' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-65]</a>

After describing the manners and customs of the
Nicaraguans, there is but little left to say of their
neighbors the Salvadorans, who resemble them in most
characteristics. It must be acknowledged, however,
that the people of Salvador are entitled to the first
rank in Central America for their industry, general
intelligence, and love of order. Individual rights are
respected among them, and well-behaved foreigners
are at all times made welcome. The Salvadorans
seem to understand what are the duties of republicans.<a name='FA_XXVIII-69' id='FA_XXVIII-69' href='#FN_XXVIII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-69]</a>
</p>

<p>
The population of Salvador consists of Indians,
ladinos, and zambos. The ladinos comprise the whites,
of which class the proportion is small, and the several
mixtures of white and Indian. The mode of living
of the latter scarcely differs from that of the Nicaraguans
or other Central Americans of the same
standing.

SALVADORAN SOCIETY.
</p>

<p>
The aboriginal peoples have undergone considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_605' name='Page_605' href='#Page_605'>605</a></span>
modification from the three centuries of contact with
the white men, and of subjugation to the Spanish
rulers. But there are towns, even near San Salvador,
the capital, which have retained many of their primitive
customs, and where the aboriginal blood has suffered
but little, if any, intermixture. The native
language has fallen into disuse in most places, and
only a few words, also accepted by the whites, are
retained.<a name='FA_XXVIII-70' id='FA_XXVIII-70' href='#FN_XXVIII-70' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-70]</a> The region known as <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">costa del bálsamo</span><a name='FA_XXVIII-71' id='FA_XXVIII-71' href='#FN_XXVIII-71' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-71]</a>
is entirely occupied by Nahua nations, whose habits
have scarcely changed since the conquest. They are
not absolutely hostile to the Europeans, but certainly
dislike any intrusion on their part. They are an
industrious people.
</p>

<p>
The aboriginal Salvadoran is, as a rule, slender in
form but muscular. Some of the women have fine
figures and graceful carriage; they walk with a firm
step and body erect. They are, both men and women,
gentle, affable, and rather hospitable; their temperament
is melancholy and dreamy. They are well-disposed
toward foreigners, and though they will not
tolerate any doubt as to the purity of their blood, yet
consider themselves insulted by being called indios.
They also look upon the whites and ladinos as usurpers
in the land. They are much given to boasting of
their courage and generosity, and wish to be taken
for a brave people. The Indian possesses a certain
quantum of honesty, but will fulfil his contracts faithfully
when his interests do not suffer by it; otherwise,
he will find a loop-hole of escape. He cannot understand
the value put by others on capital; his present
needs being covered, he cares nothing for the superfluous.<a name='FA_XXVIII-72' id='FA_XXVIII-72' href='#FN_XXVIII-72' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-72]</a>
</p>

<p>
The men are quite reserved in their manner; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_606' name='Page_606' href='#Page_606'>606</a></span>
women are different. Their desire to have children
by white men promotes looseness. They do not see
any dishonor in having foreign lovers, and children
born out of wedlock. Nearly all the Indians can read
and write, and have some knowledge of arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
The dress of the Salvadoran Indians is extremely
simple; probably the same as that worn by their ancestors.
The women use a piece of blue cotton
wrapped round the waist, and reaching only a little
below the knees; the upper part of the body being
scantily covered with a sort of chemise with an aperture
at the top for the head, and open at the sides.<a name='FA_XXVIII-73' id='FA_XXVIII-73' href='#FN_XXVIII-73' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-73]</a>
The head-dress consists of two long tresses of their
own black hair, interlaced with a red ribbon, and
wreathed round the head like a turban. They wear
neither shoes nor stockings. The men generally have
caites to their feet. Their dress is a light suit of
cotton, a straw hat or colored kerchief on the head,
and a chamarra of coarse cloth, which answers all the
purposes of cloak, blanket, carpet, and bed.
</p>

<p>
The dwellings are simple and comfortless; indeed,
they seem to have been put up with the expectation
of their being tumbled down at any moment by earthquakes.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
MUSIC AND SKY-ROCKETS.
</p>

<p>
The men leave to the women all the cares of the
house; the latter, consequently, lead a laborious and
hard life. Their food consists of eggs, venison, tortillas,
beans, rice, and fruit. They are fond of coffee,
and the men indulge freely in the use of chicha, rum,
and every other alcoholic drink that comes in their
way. The women, on the contrary, are strictly sober.<a name='FA_XXVIII-74' id='FA_XXVIII-74' href='#FN_XXVIII-74' class='fnanchor'>[XXVIII-74]</a>
Like all other christianized Indians, they devote much
of their time and substance to religious feasts, which
are generally followed by carousals and gambling,
cock-fighting being a prevalent amusement. They
have a decided liking for music, accompanying their
sad strains with the guitar, accordion, marimba, or
dulcema. The practice of burning fire-crackers and
letting off sky-rockets is quite common upon every

<p>
In Honduras, the amalgamation of races has almost
obliterated the line distinguishing whites from blacks.
The mixture of white, negro, and Indian has brought
about a population ranging in hue from chocolate to
cream color. Now and then a pure white descendant
of the old aristocratic families may be seen; but such
instances are quite rare, as few families have escaped
the amalgamation.
</p>

<p>
A war of races is among the possibilities. In
former times some families were wont to enlist blacks
and Indians in the deadly feuds of the country; now
they stand in dread of elements which will overshadow
or exterminate them, unless a timely influx of whites
from the United States and Europe shall counter-balance
the ever-increasing preponderance of the black
race.<a name='FA_XXIX-1' id='FA_XXIX-1' href='#FN_XXIX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-1]</a> However, there are a number of respectable
negro families, some of whose members have occupied
high positions in the government.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_609' name='Page_609' href='#Page_609'>609</a></span>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
WHITE, RED, AND BLACK.
</p>

<p>
The Indian or aboriginal element predominates
here as in all Central America. In some districts it
is difficult to say whose habits of life prevail, the
white or the Indian. In the eastern portion of the
state,<a name='FA_XXIX-2' id='FA_XXIX-2' href='#FN_XXIX-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-2]</a> the population is almost entirely of Xicaques
and Payas, portions of which native tribes have
accepted the catholic religion and live at peace with
the white inhabitants; the rest, living among the
mountains, conform more to their original mode of
life, but maintain friendly relations with the white
race.
</p>

<p>
The coast around Carataska Lagoon, and as far to
the westward as Brewer or Brus Lagoon, was at
one time occupied by zambos, or Mosquitos, but the
Caribs spreading rapidly eastward from Trujillo and
Black River have displaced them. The zambos have
of late years lost their former activity, and surrendered
to the besetting vice of drunkenness, which, together
with other causes, is hastening their extinction. Most
of them having been driven by the Caribs into territory
belonging to Nicaragua, the proportion of them still
remaining in Honduras must be small.
</p>

<p>
The Caribs are the descendants of the original
inhabitants of the leeward island of Saint Vincent.<a name='FA_XXIX-3' id='FA_XXIX-3' href='#FN_XXIX-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-3]</a>
The presence of negro blood among the Caribs is
explained by the foundering, when they were still
dwelling in Saint Vincent, of an African slave ship,
on one of the small islands of the vicinity.<a name='FA_XXIX-4' id='FA_XXIX-4' href='#FN_XXIX-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-4]</a> The
Caribs, both the pure and the black, are active, industrious,
and provident, and far more civilized than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_610' name='Page_610' href='#Page_610'>610</a></span>
the zambos, living in well-constructed huts, which
are kept clean and comfortable. They still retain
their original language, though most of them can speak
Spanish and a little of English. While professing
to be catholics, they retain many of their old rites and
superstitions. Being a good, frugal, intelligent, and
useful laboring population, much aid may be expected
from them in the future development of the country.
</p>

<p>
In Comayagua and Choluteca there are several
towns wholly occupied by Indians, who retain their
ancient language and many of their primitive customs.
They are industrious, provident, and peaceable; but
if left to their own unaided efforts, will never bring
about the development of the country; but with the
introduction of an intelligent and enterprising people
their good qualities could be rendered useful.
</p>

<p>
Among the ladino class the men are all polite; the
educated are well-bred; and even in the lowest walks
of life courtly language and manners prevail.<a name='FA_XXIX-5' id='FA_XXIX-5' href='#FN_XXIX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-5]</a>
</p>

<p>
The women of the higher class are rather tall, but
straight; their every movement is elegant and modest.
The brunettes with raven hair prevail as to numbers;
yet a fair complexion, with light hair, blue eyes, and
ruddy cheeks is found, particularly in the highlands.
Pretty hands and arms are common. The women of
the lower classes are generous and kind-hearted, hospitable,
gentle, frank, and patient. Upon them falls
a large share of the work done.<a name='FA_XXIX-6' id='FA_XXIX-6' href='#FN_XXIX-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-6]</a> This does not, of
course, apply to women of wealthy families, but the
fact stands that the women of the lower orders are
mere slaves, albeit they appear cheerful and happy.
The practice of men and women living together without
being married prevails here, as elsewhere in Central
America, chiefly among the lower order.<a name='FA_XXIX-7' id='FA_XXIX-7' href='#FN_XXIX-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-7]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_611' name='Page_611' href='#Page_611'>611</a></span>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
</p>

<p>
Women of the higher class are taught but little beyond
reading, writing, and a few rules of arithmetic,
playing on the guitar or piano, dancing, and presenting
a good appearance in society. This done, they are
soon taken to the altar, and their matronly duties
begin. A few young women, however, are sent to
the United States for an education.<a name='FA_XXIX-8' id='FA_XXIX-8' href='#FN_XXIX-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Dwellings in Honduras are mostly of one story;
the Hondureños, not having the excuse of earthquakes,
say that it was the mode established by their ancestors.
The sala, or parlor, is the room where the family pass
the greater part of the day, doing nothing in the forenoon.<a name='FA_XXIX-9' id='FA_XXIX-9' href='#FN_XXIX-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-9]</a>
The construction of the house is very much
like that described for Nicaragua. The residences of
the wealthier classes are cleanly and cool, and have
neat gardens in the rear, adorned with beautiful flowers
and birds in cages. There is no excess of furniture.
A bedstead, one or two chairs, and a clothes-press
form the ordinary furnishing of a bedroom. But in
the houses of the wealthier families, and where several
women reside, the rooms are more generously supplied.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast and dinner are substantial meals with the
wealthy.<a name='FA_XXIX-10' id='FA_XXIX-10' href='#FN_XXIX-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-10]</a> The manners observed at table are very
sedate, and always courteous. When wine or other
beverage is drank, the health of the master and mistress
of the house is pledged with the first glass. The
poor, especially in eastern Honduras, are badly fed,
and though generally fleshy and well formed, are not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_612' name='Page_612' href='#Page_612'>612</a></span>
constitutionally strong. In the cattle districts of
Olancho they fare better, getting all the beef they
need. Yet even the former make patient and enduring
soldiers, capable of travelling twenty leagues
a day through the mountains.<a name='FA_XXIX-11' id='FA_XXIX-11' href='#FN_XXIX-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
The upper classes adopt American and European
fashions, and costly articles of wearing apparel are in
demand. Women, as a rule, wear white dresses the
year round, or those of a light pink or blue gauzy
stuff. At parties or balls the dress is usually white
and very light. Little jewelry is worn. In the street
a woman always wears a mantilla or a shawl covering
her head. The hair is oftener worn plaited, and put
up behind the head. Ringlets are seldom seen.
Women are rarely seen out except in the morning
and toward sunset.
</p>

<p>
Men of means travel on fast mules worth at least
$150 each; the trappings being silver mounted, and
some of the bridles and head-stalls adorned with plates
of virgin silver. The Hondurans are fine riders.
Many of the females are graceful and fearless horsewomen.
The habit of riding on the right side prevails.
Sometimes the bottom of the rider's dress is
loaded with small silver coins fastened through holes
in the skirt.<a name='FA_XXIX-12' id='FA_XXIX-12' href='#FN_XXIX-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-12]</a>
</p>

<p>
All classes of the people, from the clergy down—or
up—indulge in bull and cock fights, horse-racing,
dancing, and the excitements of the monte-table, all
of which amusements generally follow the services of
the church on great civic or religious festivities.<a name='FA_XXIX-13' id='FA_XXIX-13' href='#FN_XXIX-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-13]</a>
Gambling is quite general, and thousands have been
ruined by this vice; however, there is less of it here
than in other parts of Central America. Begging is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_613' name='Page_613' href='#Page_613'>613</a></span>
a prevalent practice throughout the country, and various
devices are resorted to by the halt, maimed, blind,
and others to obtain alms.<a name='FA_XXIX-14' id='FA_XXIX-14' href='#FN_XXIX-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-14]</a> Good domestic servants
are not easily procured in Honduras; they are generally
mulattoes of poor intelligence, and exceedingly
indolent.<a name='FA_XXIX-15' id='FA_XXIX-15' href='#FN_XXIX-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-15]</a>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
CASTES AND CLASSES.
</p>

<p>
The population of Guatemala is set down at about
750,000 Indians, 430,000 ladinos or mestizos, 10,000
persons white or nearly so, 8,000 negroes or colored,
and 2,000 foreigners.<a name='FA_XXIX-16' id='FA_XXIX-16' href='#FN_XXIX-16' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-16]</a> The white men are mostly
owners of estates, and several of them belong to the
learned professions; others are engaged in trade, or
keep shops.<a name='FA_XXIX-17' id='FA_XXIX-17' href='#FN_XXIX-17' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-17]</a> The mestizos are mechanics, retail
shop-keepers, or servants. The Indians are the cultivators
of the soil, and generally speaking, the agricultural
laborers. Many mestizos, and not a few
pure Indians, however, belong to the learned professions,
and for that reason are counted among the
gentry, though not among the so-called nobles, supposed
to be descendants of the Spaniards who in
colonial times held positions under the government, or
were connected with them.
</p>

<p>
Until the liberal régime became established in 1871,
a régime which did away with the privileges of class,
there were two castes in the country; namely, the
laboring and producing class, and the governing one
which was wholly made up of consumers. Between
the two classes custom and the rulers had built up a
Chinese wall, an almost impassable barrier. That
distinction has been rapidly disappearing under the
influence of liberal laws.
</p>

<p>
The Guatemalans of the educated class are noted
for their kindly disposition, simplicity of manners, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_614' name='Page_614' href='#Page_614'>614</a></span>
high sense of justice. Both sexes are amiable, courteous,
and attentive to strangers.<a name='FA_XXIX-18' id='FA_XXIX-18' href='#FN_XXIX-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-18]</a> Notwithstanding
their good intellectual powers, owing to the effects of
climate, habit, educational and religious training, bad
government, and perhaps the combination of those
causes, they have been inclined to indolence, and have
lacked in vigor of thought, energy, and enterprise;
punctuality could not be counted among their good
traits, but a most confirmed religious bigotry prevailed
for years among all classes.<a name='FA_XXIX-19' id='FA_XXIX-19' href='#FN_XXIX-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-19]</a> An enlightened public
opinion, in both government and religious matters,
has been, however, growing from the time that the
detestable old system was overthrown, it is hoped
forever.
</p>

<p>
The youth of Guatemala are made conversant with
the etiquette of society. The higher class are quiet,
reticent, grave, and seemingly impassible, but as a
rule make good husbands, fathers, and neighbors.
They are studiously polite and punctilious, expecting
a full return from others. The women are more free,
impressive, and impressible than the other sex, gracious
in speech, unaffected and winning. They also rank
high for morality.<a name='FA_XXIX-20' id='FA_XXIX-20' href='#FN_XXIX-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-20]</a> Many of them are blondes; many
have a white skin, with dark eyes and hair.<a name='FA_XXIX-21' id='FA_XXIX-21' href='#FN_XXIX-21' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-21]</a>
</p>

<p>
The mestizos, who are the issue of white fathers
and Indian mothers, and of the promiscuous intercourse,<a name='FA_XXIX-22' id='FA_XXIX-22' href='#FN_XXIX-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-22]</a>
habitually seek the towns. They are, as a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_615' name='Page_615' href='#Page_615'>615</a></span>
class, much the superior intellectually of the pure
Indian, better educated, and less superstitious, as well
as less loyal to church and government, and too often
wicked, treacherous, and dissolute. When not injured
by early excesses the mestizos are finely built. The
younger and uncorrupted females are distinguished by
the voluptuous swell of their busts, fine lithe forms,
erect and graceful carriage. They walk with an
elastic footstep and inimitable grace and freedom.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PHYSIQUE AND DWELLINGS.
</p>

<p>
The Indians mostly dwell by themselves in villages,
many on the estates of planters, and a few in the cities
and towns.<a name='FA_XXIX-23' id='FA_XXIX-23' href='#FN_XXIX-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-23]</a> They are supposed to be intensely
catholic, but they mix in with their christianity many
heathen rites; and being partially educated by the
clergy, nearly all understand and can speak the
Spanish language. When not corrupted by military
service the aboriginal is industrious, mild, and temperate.
Those who dwell apart in their villages raise
most of the fruits and produce marketed, and make
most of the domestic articles sold in shops. Nearly
all, and particularly those of the departments of Los
Altos, have a fine physical development.
</p>

<p>
The race has been from the time of the conquest
oppressed and kept in a state of barbarous ignorance
and superstition. The régime, established since 1871,
energetically enforced by the late President Barrios,
has done much to bring about a change for the better.<a name='FA_XXIX-24' id='FA_XXIX-24' href='#FN_XXIX-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-24]</a>
</p>

<p>
The Lacandones have been specially spoken of by
several authors who have written on Guatemala. The
Spaniards, after attempting in the latter end of the
seventeenth century to pacify the warlike Indian provinces,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_616' name='Page_616' href='#Page_616'>616</a></span>
including the Lacandon region, resolved upon
forcibly removing the Indian towns. The Indians of
the town of Dolores were generally quiet, but as an expensive
garrison would be required to make sure of
their continuing at peace, the inhabitants were removed
first to Aquespala, next for some unknown reason to
San Ramon, and finally to Santa Catarina de Retalhuleu.<a name='FA_XXIX-25' id='FA_XXIX-25' href='#FN_XXIX-25' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-25]</a>
These changes caused much suffering; a large
number died, others became scattered, but most of
them returned to their native mountains.<a name='FA_XXIX-26' id='FA_XXIX-26' href='#FN_XXIX-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-26]</a> The government
of Guatemala tried in 1831 and 1837 to bring
the Lacandones under its authority, but all its efforts
failed, and they have since retained their independence,
though seemingly they have abandoned their
old predatory habits, contenting themselves with preserving
their isolation.<a name='FA_XXIX-27' id='FA_XXIX-27' href='#FN_XXIX-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-27]</a>
</p>

<p>
The above remarks refer to the western Lacandones,
who live on or near the Pasion River, and its tributaries.
The eastern Lacandones are a harmless tribe
who hold no relations with and fear the others.<a name='FA_XXIX-28' id='FA_XXIX-28' href='#FN_XXIX-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-28]</a>
</p>

<p>
The dwellings of the citizens of Guatemala are generally
of only one story, but the capital and other
cities present fine houses of two stories; as a rule the
houses are commodious, and abundantly supplied with
water. Those of the wealthy are elegantly furnished,
and the rest tolerably well provided, the floors being
covered with mattings. The habitations of the poor
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_617' name='Page_617' href='#Page_617'>617</a></span>
and Indians are mere thatched huts and altogether
comfortless.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DRESS AND FOOD.
</p>

<p>
The upper or educated class follow in their dress
the fashions of Europe and the United States. The
women, however, wear a mantilla or shawl and veil
when going to church, and appear without any covering
of the head when walking out or on a visit. They
like to adorn their hair with flowers.<a name='FA_XXIX-29' id='FA_XXIX-29' href='#FN_XXIX-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-29]</a> The men are
rather modest in their apparel, and only when equipped
for travelling do they exhibit some ostentation. At
such times, their weapons, the trappings of their horses
or mules, and other ornaments are expensive, provided
their means will allow the indulgence.
</p>

<p>
The following was the dress worn in the first quarter
of the present century by the women of the lower
order, not included in the wealthy class. Short red
petticoats, with deep plain white flounces round the
bottom, gathered up in very thick plaits over their
hips with a white border; thence upwards, they had
only a chemise to cover them.<a name='FA_XXIX-30' id='FA_XXIX-30' href='#FN_XXIX-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-30]</a> The hair in front
was in the madonna form, and the hinder part, being
of great length, was divided into tightly plaited cords,
which were twisted round the head in various devices.
A pink satin shoe, without stockings, completed the
costume. Most of the Guatemala damsels of the lower
classes dressed in that style, excepting that more frequently
they went without shoes, this being specially
noted in the servant class.<a name='FA_XXIX-31' id='FA_XXIX-31' href='#FN_XXIX-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-31]</a> Some changes have occurred
since then, and a considerable number of the
lower order have adopted the custom of dressing like
the wealthy, but as a rule a marked difference exists
between the two classes.
</p>

<p>
Men of the mechanic class generally dress like the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_618' name='Page_618' href='#Page_618'>618</a></span>
upper class; the laborers rarely have more than a shirt
and trousers; and occasionally a round jacket. Many
go barefooted or wear the caite. A common palm or
straw hat covers the head. The village or agricultural
Indians go scantily clad. The best wear of a
male consists of a straw hat, a short-sleeved shirt, short
breeches, and caites. The females rarely sport more
than a loose waistcoat, and a short petticoat, or a
cloth wrapped round the waist, reaching a little below
the knees. Children of both sexes run nude.
</p>

<p>
The food of the Guatemalans is about the same as
that of other Central Americans of their respective
classes. Travellers will find mesones to provide shelter
and refreshments for man and beast at certain
distances on their journey.<a name='FA_XXIX-32' id='FA_XXIX-32' href='#FN_XXIX-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-32]</a> At places where no inns
exist, the traveller will be accommodated by the
priest, or by the alcalde in the town hall.
</p>

<p>
The Guatemalans, like all Central Americans, are
fond of bull and cock fighting,<a name='FA_XXIX-33' id='FA_XXIX-33' href='#FN_XXIX-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-33]</a> as well as of games of
chance, which are indulged in with great frequency.<a name='FA_XXIX-34' id='FA_XXIX-34' href='#FN_XXIX-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-34]</a>
The government endeavors to provide amusements of
a more intellectual and refined character. It built a
fine theatre in the capital, and from time to time subsidizes
musical and dramatic troupes.<a name='FA_XXIX-35' id='FA_XXIX-35' href='#FN_XXIX-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-35]</a>
</p>

<p>
Begging is common. The sight of a crowd of beggars
in rags, many of them exhibiting their sores, is
very repulsive. Those beggars are supported by public
charity and are rarely sent away without relief.<a name='FA_XXIX-36' id='FA_XXIX-36' href='#FN_XXIX-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-36]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_619' name='Page_619' href='#Page_619'>619</a></span>

<p class="sidenote">
DISEASES AND HOSPITALS.
</p>

<p>
The several states of Central America have often
been visited with calamities in the form of storms and
hurricanes, freshets, and fires, causing heavy losses of
property, and at times of life also. Disease causes its
destruction as elsewhere, and often maladies in an epidemic
form have decimated the population. Fevers
are rare, except on the coasts, where they prevail during
the hottest months.<a name='FA_XXIX-37' id='FA_XXIX-37' href='#FN_XXIX-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-37]</a> The small-pox has on several
occasions done havoc among the population. The
invasions of the malady in 1851 in Costa Rica, 1862
in Guatemala and Honduras,<a name='FA_XXIX-38' id='FA_XXIX-38' href='#FN_XXIX-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-38]</a> and in 1883 in Costa
Rica, have been specially recorded in those countries.<a name='FA_XXIX-39' id='FA_XXIX-39' href='#FN_XXIX-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-39]</a>
</p>

<p>
Leprosy prevailing in several parts of Central
America, special hospitals have been established in
some of the republics for the reception and care of
persons thus afflicted.<a name='FA_XXIX-40' id='FA_XXIX-40' href='#FN_XXIX-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-40]</a> Syphilis exists in Central
America, but is not so prevalent as in Mexico. In
some parts laws have been enacted to regulate the
social evil.<a name='FA_XXIX-41' id='FA_XXIX-41' href='#FN_XXIX-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-41]</a>
</p>

<p>
That great scourge of the present century in Europe
and America, Asiatic cholera, has repeatedly invaded
the Central American states, carrying vast numbers
to destruction. In 1836 it desolated the largest cities,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_620' name='Page_620' href='#Page_620'>620</a></span>
and everywhere created the utmost consternation.<a name='FA_XXIX-42' id='FA_XXIX-42' href='#FN_XXIX-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-42]</a>
It again made its appearance in the early part of July
1855. A soldier died in Fort San Juan. A few days
later a boat-load of cholera patients came to Granada,
and forthwith the malady spread throughout Nicaragua
and the rest of Central America, its heart-rending
effects not ceasing in Salvador and Guatemala till
toward the latter part of 1857.<a name='FA_XXIX-43' id='FA_XXIX-43' href='#FN_XXIX-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-43]</a> The disease broke
out again epidemically in Nicaragua toward the end
of 1866, and continued its ravages there and in Honduras
in 1867 and 1868, and it appears that some
cases occurred in Honduras even as late as 1871.<a name='FA_XXIX-44' id='FA_XXIX-44' href='#FN_XXIX-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXIX-44]</a>
</p>

<p>
The several republics have provided hospitals for
the care of the indigent poor, as well as other benevolent
establishments for the comfort of orphans and
others needing public support. There are also charitable
societies affording great relief to the sick and
destitute.

<p>
During the last years of colonial rule the government
displayed some interest on behalf of public
education in Central America. It was, however,
religious rather than secular, and the consequence was
that liberal ideas were not countenanced. After the
establishment of the republic, and while the liberal
system prevailed, this important branch was not neglected.<a name='FA_XXX-1' id='FA_XXX-1' href='#FN_XXX-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-1]</a>

<p>
The efforts of general and local authorities, as well
as of private individuals, for the spread of instruction
among the masses were never discontinued, education
being more or less under ecclesiastical control till
August 1881, when it was placed under the supervision
of the national executive. Thus far educational
results were far from satisfactory, the statistics
in November 1883 showing, that throughout the
republic only 14.70 per centum of the population
could read and write.<a name='FA_XXX-5' id='FA_XXX-5' href='#FN_XXX-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-5]</a> Nevertheless, there are many
well-educated men, who received their instruction in
the schools, colleges, and university, and have attained
good standing in the several learned professions, and
in political life.

<p>
The labor to enlighten the masses continues unabated,
with hopes of better success. No works of
literary importance have been issued from the press
in Costa Rica, and only a few newspapers, other than
the official journal, are published.

The advantage to Nicaragua of possessing an educated

been increased; and schools of agriculture, arts, and

established. Teachers of both sexes have been brought
from the United States and Europe. It is hoped that
these efforts, persistently sustained, will yield the
better fruits. Indeed, President Cárdenas' message

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_625' name='Page_625' href='#Page_625'>625</a></span>

</p>

<p>
The Lancasterian system of education was introduced
in Honduras, as in the rest of Central America,
early during the confederation system, and has been
continued with some modifications. There may, possibly,
be 400 schools in all the state, each with an
average attendance of 25 pupils, making an average
of 10,000 pupils of all classes in a total population of
350,000 to 400,000 souls. There are no libraries in

<p>
The retrogressive government which ruled over
Guatemala for more than thirty years, down to 1871
when it was overthrown, not only failed to make adequate
provision for the education of the masses, but
endeavored to keep them in a state of ignorance and
fanaticism. The new régime hastened to bring on a
change, being convinced that without an educated
people, democratic institutions would be impossible.
Primary schools were accordingly established as fast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_626' name='Page_626' href='#Page_626'>626</a></span>
as circumstances and the condition of the treasury permitted,
in every town and village. In 1876 their
number had already reached 600, and progress was
uninterrupted after that.<a name='FA_XXX-22' id='FA_XXX-22' href='#FN_XXX-22' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-22]</a> Secondary and professional
education have also been fostered. There are three
national institutes of secondary instruction for males
and two for females, a normal school for training
teachers; also several of special instruction, namely,
agriculture, design, arts, and trades; one for the deaf
and dumb and two of law, one of medicine, and one
of engineering. Since 1882 schools of music and elocution
and a mercantile academy<a name='FA_XXX-23' id='FA_XXX-23' href='#FN_XXX-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-23]</a> have been added.
Special mention should be made of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Politécnica</span>,
or military academy, in which a liberal education is
afforded, comprising English and French, a thorough
course of science, including mathematics and drawing,
in addition to the specialties of the military profession.<a name='FA_XXX-24' id='FA_XXX-24' href='#FN_XXX-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-24]</a>

The national university, which during the old régime

Bewitched, who ruled in the latter part of the seventeenth

<p class="sidenote">
RELIGION AND THE CLERGY.
</p>

<p>
It is hardly necessary to mention the fact that the
catholic religion was the only form of worship recognized
or tolerated in Central America during the
Spanish domination. Its clergy enjoyed here the
same privileges, and were subject to the same duties
and restrictions, as in Mexico. In the short period
that the country was an appendage of the Mexican
empire, no change took place in the relations between
church and state. But soon after the establishment
of the Central American confederation, and while the
liberal democratic party was in power, efforts were
made to do away with the privileges of the clergy,
and to bring them under subjection to the civil authority.<a name='FA_XXX-28' id='FA_XXX-28' href='#FN_XXX-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-28]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_628' name='Page_628' href='#Page_628'>628</a></span>
Pursuant to this policy several laws and measures
were adopted against the clergy in general, and
Archbishop Casaus in particular,<a name='FA_XXX-29' id='FA_XXX-29' href='#FN_XXX-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-29]</a> which irritated the
anti-liberals and roused the ire of the clericals, who
at once gave utterance to the most fanatical language;
and there were even liberal-minded men who took up
the cause of the friars and abused in the press some
of the wisest measures.<a name='FA_XXX-30' id='FA_XXX-30' href='#FN_XXX-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-30]</a> Serious troubles ensued;
but during several years the legislative action was
sustained, and still more radical resolutions were
adopted. In 1829 the archbishop and a portion of
his clergy being detected in plotting against the government
were forthwith sent out of the country.
Two months later the general congress declared religious
orders at an end in the republic.<a name='FA_XXX-31' id='FA_XXX-31' href='#FN_XXX-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-31]</a>

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.
</p>

<p>
Finally, in 1832, religious freedom was proclaimed,<a name='FA_XXX-32' id='FA_XXX-32' href='#FN_XXX-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-32]</a>
and it was moreover declared that the appointment to
church dignities pertained to the nation, and should
be made by the executive.<a name='FA_XXX-33' id='FA_XXX-33' href='#FN_XXX-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-33]</a> The church was thus
brought low; but a reaction came erelong, and with
the practical dissolution of the confederation, the serviles,
then in power, undid what their opponents had
done, and among other acts restored the privileges of
the clergy, and also the monastic orders.<a name='FA_XXX-34' id='FA_XXX-34' href='#FN_XXX-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-34]</a> For all
that, the church had been struck blows from which it
never fully recovered. It is true that the masses
still cherished a portion of their former religious bigotry,
but from year to year it has been giving way to
move liberal sentiments, and foreigners never encountered
any difficulty to remain on the score of religion,
so long as they respected the prejudices of the people.<a name='FA_XXX-35' id='FA_XXX-35' href='#FN_XXX-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-35]</a>
The shameless immorality of the priests has tended to
develop a feeling of indifference to religion, and to
weaken the reverence formerly felt toward its ministers.
Being shielded by the fuero eclesiástico from
trial by the common courts, the clergy were practically
exempt from deserved punishment, provided they were
submissive to their superiors.<a name='FA_XXX-36' id='FA_XXX-36' href='#FN_XXX-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-36]</a> Superadded to which
was the repeated interference of the clergy in political
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_630' name='Page_630' href='#Page_630'>630</a></span>
affairs, which had been so baneful that the people
came to learn what was the proper orbit of church
and state respectively.

eighty years.<a name='FA_XXX-37' id='FA_XXX-37' href='#FN_XXX-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-37]</a> During his absence, the archdiocese
of Guatemala was in charge of Francisco de Paula

and coadjutor with right of succession, who became
Casaus' successor<a name='FA_XXX-38' id='FA_XXX-38' href='#FN_XXX-38' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-38]</a> and held the office till his death,
on the 25th of January, 1867.<a name='FA_XXX-39' id='FA_XXX-39' href='#FN_XXX-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-39]</a> The next occupant
of the see was Bernardo Piñol y Aycinena, late bishop
of Nicaragua, from September 1868. The expulsion
by the provisional government, in 1871, of the jesuits,
together with the confiscation of their estates, and the
apprehension of further action against the clergy,
prompted the archbishop and many of his subjects to
promote a counter-revolution; their plans failed, and
the archbishop, together with Mariano Ortiz y Urruela,
bishop of Teya in partibus infidelium, was expelled
from the country; neither of them ever returned.<a name='FA_XXX-40' id='FA_XXX-40' href='#FN_XXX-40' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-40]</a>

American confederation, opposed the creation of
a bishopric in Salvador, concluded, in 1842, upon its
creation with a bishop who should uphold their ideas.
Jorge Viteri y Ungo went to Rome on this mission,

to the state of Salvador. His career has been detailed
elsewhere, as well as the cause of his banishment.
After his departure the pope, at the request of the
Salvadoran government, made Tomás Miguel Pineda
y Zaldaña, bishop of Antígora, in partibus infidelium,

to the see of Nicaragua, he became the real bishop.<a name='FA_XXX-50' id='FA_XXX-50' href='#FN_XXX-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-50]</a>

The republican government from a very early time
understood that the immense power wielded by the
church was incompatible with the spirit of the age,
and began gradually, almost year by year, to curtail
it, and to loosen the ties formerly existing between the
civil and ecclesiastical authorities. In the decade from
1851 to 1860, the church lost much of its political
sway, but still held the powerful lever of its great
wealth. It was afterward deprived of that wealth,
and its much-abused power ceased. This occurred
during the war begun in 1860 by the liberal party
under General Mosquera against the conservatives, in
which the clergy took sides with the latter. Mosquera
triumphed; and his first measure was to destroy the
power of the church. He issued decrees confiscating
its whole property.<a name='FA_XXX-68' id='FA_XXX-68' href='#FN_XXX-68' class='fnanchor'>[XXX-68]</a> That was, of course, accompanied

During the Spanish rule the administration of
justice in Central America was vested in the real
audiencia, composed of a regente, several oidores, a
fiscal, and secretary, the governor, captain-general of
the provinces, being ex-officio the president. The
courts of first resort were filled by alcaldes mayores.<a name='FA_XXXI-1' id='FA_XXXI-1' href='#FN_XXXI-1' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-1]</a>

<p>
One great step taken early in the nineteenth century
was the abolition of torture of prisoners and witnesses.<a name='FA_XXXI-2' id='FA_XXXI-2' href='#FN_XXXI-2' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-2]</a>
The córtes had previously, in September
1813, decreed the abolishment of flogging for crime,
or in houses of correction, seminaries, schools, etc.<a name='FA_XXXI-3' id='FA_XXXI-3' href='#FN_XXXI-3' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-3]</a>
</p>

<p>
Soon after the establishment of the Central American
confederation, the national constituent assembly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_639' name='Page_639' href='#Page_639'>639</a></span>
organized a supreme court of justice for the state of
Guatemala. Since the dissolution of the confederation,
the judicial system of the several states has
undergone many changes, which it would occupy too
much space to detail here.<a name='FA_XXXI-4' id='FA_XXXI-4' href='#FN_XXXI-4' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-4]</a> I will therefore confine
myself to the present organizations, giving such other
particulars as are of general interest.

<p class="sidenote">
PRESENT JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
</p>

<p>
In Guatemala the administration of justice is intrusted
to a supreme court, four chambers or sections
of second resort in the capital, and one court of second
resort in Quezaltenango.<a name='FA_XXXI-5' id='FA_XXXI-5' href='#FN_XXXI-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-5]</a> There are also courts of
first resort and lower courts for the adjudication of
petty civil cases, or the correction of trivial offences.
The jury system was formally established by the liberal
government in 1872.<a name='FA_XXXI-6' id='FA_XXXI-6' href='#FN_XXXI-6' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-6]</a>
</p>

<p>
The legislature, recognizing the necessity of amending
the existing codes, authorized the executive to
issue laws conducive thereto, which was done.<a name='FA_XXXI-7' id='FA_XXXI-7' href='#FN_XXXI-7' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-7]</a> The
government has caused the construction of two penitentiaries,
one in the city of Guatemala, and the other
in Quezaltenango.<a name='FA_XXXI-8' id='FA_XXXI-8' href='#FN_XXXI-8' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-8]</a>
</p>

<p>
Under the late organization justice is administered
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_640' name='Page_640' href='#Page_640'>640</a></span>
with fair regularity and promptness.<a name='FA_XXXI-9' id='FA_XXXI-9' href='#FN_XXXI-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-9]</a> During Barrios'
rule an efficient police was organized in the capital.
</p>

<p>
In Honduras the absence of a penal code caused
delays in the prosecution of criminals, and there being
no good jails or prisons, their offences often went unwhipped
of justice.<a name='FA_XXXI-10' id='FA_XXXI-10' href='#FN_XXXI-10' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-10]</a> Hence the numerous robbers and
assassins then infesting the frontiers. However, we
are assured that in the well-settled portions of the
country life and property were secure. Capital punishment
being abolished by the constitution, the
severest punishment that could be inflicted was that
of 500 blows with a heavy withe of the consistency
of India-rubber.<a name='FA_XXXI-11' id='FA_XXXI-11' href='#FN_XXXI-11' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-11]</a>
</p>

<p>
The government in 1876 and succeeding years introduced
reforms in the police department. The political
disturbances, which had nullified the action of the
courts, being now at an end, the supreme and lower
courts were at once reorganized, and permitted to exercise
their functions. But the non-existence of suitable
penal establishments, and the antiquated legislation,
were powerful drawbacks. The minister-general
was directed by the president to procure the best
works on legislation, and the most noted codes on
civil and criminal matters, as well as on mining, commerce,
etc., with the view of placing the materials in
the hands of competent persons, who were to form
codes suited to the requirements of the country.<a name='FA_XXXI-12' id='FA_XXXI-12' href='#FN_XXXI-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-12]</a>
Such work demands careful study, and time to accomplish
it. I am not aware that it is even commenced.

The laws have never been collected and revised to

COSTA RICA JUDICIARY.
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica, as soon as she became a member of the
Central American confederation, organized a judiciary
of her own, consisting of a superior court, several tribunals
of first resort in the provinces, and the alcaldes
of towns, who were justices of the peace, with jurisdiction
over petty affairs both civil and criminal. The
supreme court has since undergone many changes,
which would occupy too much space to detail. Its
members have been sometimes appointed by the executive,
and at others chosen by the people or the legislative
body.<a name='FA_XXXI-27' id='FA_XXXI-27' href='#FN_XXXI-27' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-27]</a> At present, they are elective, the court
being formed with the following personnel: president
of the full court, presidents of the first and second
sections, six justices, secretary, and the requisite clerks,
etc.<a name='FA_XXXI-28' id='FA_XXXI-28' href='#FN_XXXI-28' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-28]</a> The administration of justice in the first instance
is vested in courts sitting in each province, and
having civil and criminal jurisdiction, except in the
province of San José, which has a civil and a criminal
court, distinct from one another.<a name='FA_XXXI-29' id='FA_XXXI-29' href='#FN_XXXI-29' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-29]</a>
</p>

<p>
Costa Rica adopted in or about 1841 a civil and
penal code, and likewise a code of procedure, with
which she rid herself of the old cumbersome and expensive
legislation.<a name='FA_XXXI-30' id='FA_XXXI-30' href='#FN_XXXI-30' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-30]</a> But nothing was done toward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_644' name='Page_644' href='#Page_644'>644</a></span>
improving this work. Indeed, the administration of
justice in Costa Rica is not what it should be, not for
lack of honesty, ability, or laboriousness on the part
of the courts, but because of the antiquated and inadequate
civil legislation and mode of procedure.<a name='FA_XXXI-31' id='FA_XXXI-31' href='#FN_XXXI-31' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-31]</a>
</p>

<p>
The government, after obtaining the authorization
of the national congress, appointed a commission to
form new codes.<a name='FA_XXXI-32' id='FA_XXXI-32' href='#FN_XXXI-32' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-32]</a> No difficulties were apprehended
in regard to the civil code; but the penal code, involving
the manner of dealing with criminals, has required
a more careful study, with the view of abandoning the
old vindictive system.<a name='FA_XXXI-33' id='FA_XXXI-33' href='#FN_XXXI-33' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-33]</a>
</p>

<p>
Under the new penal code there were to be three
separate presidios for different grades of criminals;
but owing to scarcity of funds only two were established,
one on Coco Island, and the other on San
Lúcas.<a name='FA_XXXI-34' id='FA_XXXI-34' href='#FN_XXXI-34' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-34]</a> But later, under an executive order of November
6, 1882, the prisoners on Coco were removed
to San Lúcas, and thus were the three presidios which
should have been separate merged into one.

<p>
Under the latest constitution of the state of Panamá,
the judiciary was comprised of the following: a superior
court in the state capital;<a name='FA_XXXI-35' id='FA_XXXI-35' href='#FN_XXXI-35' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-35]</a> one district court for civil
and one for criminal affairs in the same city; in the
other departments the district judge has jurisdiction
over civil and criminal causes. In each ward of the
capital there is an alcalde, and in the country a regidor
for each canton.<a name='FA_XXXI-36' id='FA_XXXI-36' href='#FN_XXXI-36' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-36]</a>

was that of ten years in chains with hard labor.<a name='FA_XXXI-37' id='FA_XXXI-37' href='#FN_XXXI-37' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-37]</a> A

general to codify all existing laws. The contract was
fully carried out, and the state became possessed of a
full and well-arranged system of legislation.
</p>

<p>
Of the criminal prosecutions initiated in 1876 only
thirteen per centum resulted in convictions, which
elicited from the government secretary some deprecatory
remarks.<a name='FA_XXXI-39' id='FA_XXXI-39' href='#FN_XXXI-39' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-39]</a> The state had in 1880 an organized

In regard to the military department of the Isthmus,
hardly anything can be said with certainty. It
might possibly, in an emergency, keep under arms
3,000 or 4,000 men for a short period. The force in

or 500 to 75.<a name='FA_XXXI-42' id='FA_XXXI-42' href='#FN_XXXI-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-42]</a> The number of commissioned officers

The general government of Colombia usually keeps a
force of its own, varying between 150 and 500 men,
with the double object of guarding the transit from
interruption, and of controlling the political situation.
</p>

<p>
The available military force of Costa Rica for active
service is close upon 15,000 men, to which must be
added a reserve of nearly 6,000, the national guard of
about 3,500, and the field and company officers numbering
2,485. The garrisons of San José, Cartago,
Heredia, Alajuela, Liberia, and Puntarenas in 1883
aggregated less than 500, including officers, and 85
musicians, a reduction of 128 from the preceding
year.<a name='FA_XXXI-44' id='FA_XXXI-44' href='#FN_XXXI-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-44]</a> The garrison formerly kept at the president's

<p>
In Nicaragua the army continued in the biennial
period of 1881-2, as formerly organized, in three divisions
of 3,200 men each, which might easily be increased,
but that number was deemed sufficient to
cover the garrisons.<a name='FA_XXXI-46' id='FA_XXXI-46' href='#FN_XXXI-46' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-46]</a> The republic is provided with

Nicaragua may in the course of time become a
maritime nation. At present there is no Nicaraguan
navy. The naval service is reduced to the mere
police of the ports of San Juan del Norte, San Juan

<p>
Honduras has but a small number of men under
arms in time of peace, but all male citizens from 18
to 50 years must do military service in time of war.<a name='FA_XXXI-48' id='FA_XXXI-48' href='#FN_XXXI-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-48]</a>
</p>

<p>
The men do not make a fine display, but will march
from 50 to 60 miles a day with no other food than a
plantain and a little cheese, and when well officered,
will fight desperately.
</p>

<p>
The government has had it in contemplation to
introduce some order in the service, and to develop a
sentiment of respect and appreciation of the military
profession; but I am not aware that any change for
the better has taken place. Honduras has forts at
Omoa and Trujillo, the same which existed in the
Spanish domination; they could offer resistance to
scarcely any force bombarding them from the sea.
</p>

<p>
The government of Salvador, in May 1879, ordered
a complete reorganization of the army, fixing its force
at 20,000 men in four divisions,<a name='FA_XXXI-49' id='FA_XXXI-49' href='#FN_XXXI-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-49]</a> whose commander-in-chief
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_648' name='Page_648' href='#Page_648'>648</a></span>
should be the president of the republic,<a name='FA_XXXI-50' id='FA_XXXI-50' href='#FN_XXXI-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-50]</a> who
allowed himself four aides-de-camp of the rank of colonel,
four of the grade of lieutenant-colonel, and eight
others from captains to sub-lieutenants. The term of
military service was fixed at six years, each man being
credited with double time for active service. The
cost of the force doing garrison duty, which in 1876
had been fixed at 1,427 men—exclusive of the general
staff, other officers of all grades, and two music bands—was
computed at $31,788 per month.<a name='FA_XXXI-51' id='FA_XXXI-51' href='#FN_XXXI-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-51]</a>
</p>

<p>
An act of congress of January 1877 suppressed
pensions of officials on retiring from service, and extended
the rule to military men having means of their
own for support. The retired pension was to be paid
only to destitute ones, and in no case was it to exceed
fifty dollars a month.<a name='FA_XXXI-52' id='FA_XXXI-52' href='#FN_XXXI-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-52]</a> A new military code was promulgated
on the 1st of January, 1880.<a name='FA_XXXI-53' id='FA_XXXI-53' href='#FN_XXXI-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-53]</a>
</p>

<p>
In Guatemala military service is required of every
male citizen of the ages of 18 to 50, excepting Indians,
priests, 'students,' and those who pay fifty dollars a
year for exemption.<a name='FA_XXXI-54' id='FA_XXXI-54' href='#FN_XXXI-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXXI-54]</a> The strength of the army is
estimated at 16,000, but there is no doubt that a larger
force can be raised when needed. The following are
the grades of commissioned officers in the service:

an industrious population and peace to develop its
immense natural wealth. The chief productions are
Indian corn, sugar-cane, rice, a great variety of fruits,
vegetables, and nutritious roots, such as yam, yucca,
etc. Agriculture has been limited to the supply of
edibles, and of late years to the shipment of some fruit
to the United States. The cultivation of sugar and
coffee might be made profitable, though requiring a
large outlay, but for being dependent on an uncertain
supply of labor. In 1862 and 1863, cotton culture
was undertaken in the interior with fair success, and
in 1864 had spread all over the country.<a name='FA_XXXII-23' id='FA_XXXII-23' href='#FN_XXXII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXXII-23]</a> The plant

Of the five states of Central America, Honduras
appears to be the most plentifully supplied with mineral
wealth. Mount Merendon was long celebrated
for its silver and gold mines. Until about thirty or
forty years ago, mining was the most prominent interest
in the state, but wars and political disturbances
caused the abandonment of the mines, and the works
fell into decay, after which there was neither enterprise,
capital, nor skill to restore them. The owners
of the property afterward became owners of immense
grazing estates. Some mines were continued in operation,

The national highways of Costa Rica are not all in
the best condition, which is due to the destructive
force of the winter rains. The government, however,
endeavors to render them serviceable. In Nicaragua,
the public roads, prior to the construction of railways,
were only fit for mule travel, except at short distances
from towns, which wagons could traverse. In the
rainy season they were impassable, owing either to
mud or swollen streams. The same is to be said respecting
those of Honduras. Much has been successfully
accomplished in late years in the improvement
of roads and construction of bridges. Salvador appropriated
in 1876 funds for macadamizing the public
highways. Guatemala is well provided with roads
and bridges, and derives a considerable revenue from
tolls to keep them in repair, and to construct new
ones.<a name='FA_XXXIII-12' id='FA_XXXIII-12' href='#FN_XXXIII-12' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-12]</a> Railways and telegraphs are treated of elsewhere.

The monetary unit of Costa Rica is the peso of one
hundred centavos, with 25 grammes of silver of the

silver, and copper.<a name='FA_XXXIII-13' id='FA_XXXIII-13' href='#FN_XXXIII-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-13]</a>

Gold coin became very scarce in Nicaragua. There
was no copper, and the smallest of silver was the half-real.
Gold coins of the United States, Great Britain,

Switzerland, Belgium, Mexico, Peru, and Spain, were
current for their full value.<a name='FA_XXXIII-14' id='FA_XXXIII-14' href='#FN_XXXIII-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-14]</a> In Salvador nearly all

Honduras the currency was much vitiated by the introduction
of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">moneda provisional</span>—copper slightly
alloyed with silver—of the denominations of quarter
and half dollars, of which probably $1,500,000, nominal

The discovery of gold in California, as is well known,
restored life to the Isthmus of Panamá. In December
1849, the first emigrants went across, bound for
the new El Dorado. In 1850 there was a large
travel,<a name='FA_XXXIII-23' id='FA_XXXIII-23' href='#FN_XXXIII-23' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-23]</a> notwithstanding innumerable difficulties and
discomforts. After the construction of the railway
the traffic over it still increased; most of it was in
transitu, but the local trade was not insignificant.<a name='FA_XXXIII-24' id='FA_XXXIII-24' href='#FN_XXXIII-24' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-24]</a>

of the sixth decade of this century the transit traffic
through the Isthmus became greatly diminished.
This was mainly due to the construction of the overland
railway to the Pacific in the United States, and
to the establishment of a British line of large and fleet
steamers running from Europe to ports in the south
Pacific through the straits of Magellan, affording advantages
over the Panamá railroad transportation.

<p>
The transportation of passengers and merchandise
to and from the Isthmus has been mainly effected by
steamship lines—American and British during the
first fourteen or fifteen years, to which were subsequently
added those of a French company; and still
later those of a German one.<a name='FA_XXXIII-26' id='FA_XXXIII-26' href='#FN_XXXIII-26' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-26]</a>

some merchants did a banking business. Bills of exchange

The Pearl Islands, comprising sixteen islands and
numerous rocks, had a population of about 2,000 souls,
about 700 of whom were engaged six months of the
year in pearl fishing, which yielded about 1,000 tons
of pearl shells valued at $70 per ton, and pearls enough
to raise the value of both to $300,000 yearly. This
industry had almost ceased to exist in 1873, owing to
recklessness. Fishing for pearl oysters was forbidden
by law on the 7th of May, 1872, for the term of five
years, in order to allow the mollusk time to renew its
vitality, which was in danger of destruction; but so
far the measure has had no visibly good effects, and
the fishery has not been revived. Pearl fishing was
carried on with success by the Indians of Costa Rica

$1,377,000, which was somewhat more than it had
received. No further payments were made after October
1876. Consequently, at the end of 1885 the
nation was owing, on account of that loan, £468,600
of principal, and £276,474 for interest, aggregating
£745,074, which with exchange at 20 per cent make
$4,470,444. Moreover, there is due by Guatemala,

In Panamá the receipts of the treasury from all

from Spain, this nation being then at war with
her American colonies, were $746,241.<a name='FA_XXXIII-67' id='FA_XXXIII-67' href='#FN_XXXIII-67' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-67]</a> In 1827,

the law suppressing custom-houses in the ports of the
Isthmus, the revenue of the province in 1847 became
reduced $77,880. The amount appropriated by the
provincial legislature in October 1849, for expenses of
the fiscal year 1840-59, was $51,220.<a name='FA_XXXIII-69' id='FA_XXXIII-69' href='#FN_XXXIII-69' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIII-69]</a>

<p>
After the organization of the Isthmus as a state of
the Colombian confederation, there being no receipts
from customs, the chief portion of the expenses has
been met with a tax assessed on merchants and shop-keepers,
estimated on the amount of business done by
each, the legislative assembly fixing annually the sum
required for the next year's expenditures, and the
proportion of it to be covered by the commercial tax.
The state received $50,000 out of the annual subvention
of $250,000 paid by the railway company to the
Colombian government. Other sources of revenue
have been the taxes levied on steamship agencies,
consumption, slaughter of cattle, ice, distilleries, and
several others which in the aggregate are not insignificant.

object of search, was at last found in 1851 by an
English expedition. The discovery was effected by
Robert Le Mesurier McClure, who, in command of
the <i>Investigator</i>, sailed, together with the <i>Enterprise</i>
under Richard Collinson, from England in 1850. Before
the close of the year, McClure passed Point Barrow,
pushed along the continent, doubled the south
end of Banks Island, and sailed through Prince of
Wales' Strait, where he wintered near Melville Sound.
In 1851, the west side of the peninsular part of Wollaston
Island to Prince Albert's Sound was surveyed.
By finding the strait connecting the continental channel
with Melville Sound, McClure became the discoverer
of the north-west passage, and was the first
navigator to pass from Bering Strait to Baffin Bay.<a name='FA_XXXIV-5' id='FA_XXXIV-5' href='#FN_XXXIV-5' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-5]</a>

McClure with the <i>Investigator</i> was shut in during the

he resolved to abandon the ship and seek Mackenzie
River and Lancaster Sound in two parties, a journey
which would have been disastrous. At this moment,

The necessity of shorter communication between

TEHUANTEPEC ISTHMUS.

<p>
The breadth of the isthmus of Tehuantepec between
the bays of Campeche and Tehuantepec at the narrowest
point is 130 miles. It is drained by the rivers
Coatzacoalcos and Tehuantepec, the former running
northward, discharging its waters into the first-named
bay, and extending over three fourths of the width of
this isthmus; the latter flowing into the bay of
Tehuantepec. There are several lakes and lagoons.
At one time it was proposed to cut a canal across this
isthmus, and to improve the navigation of the Coatzacoalcos,
to which end surveys were made.<a name='FA_XXXIV-9' id='FA_XXXIV-9' href='#FN_XXXIV-9' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-9]</a> But no

NICARAGUA ISTHMUS.

<p>
The idea of uniting the two oceans, by means of a
canal across the isthmus of Nicaragua, occupied the
attention of the Spanish court from a very early day
after the conquest to the last years of its occupation
of the country.<a name='FA_XXXIV-13' id='FA_XXXIV-13' href='#FN_XXXIV-13' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-13]</a> Since the separation of Central
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_695' name='Page_695' href='#Page_695'>695</a></span>
America from the crown, the canal scheme has ever
been uppermost in the minds of her rulers and thinking
men, and many scientific engineers and capitalists of
Europe and America have taken a deep interest
therein. But for divers reasons nothing was accomplished
toward establishing an adequate interoceanic
communication, in any form, down to 1849.<a name='FA_XXXIV-14' id='FA_XXXIV-14' href='#FN_XXXIV-14' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-14]</a> This
year a new arrangement was made with Cornelius
Vanderbilt and Joseph L. White of New York, in
which the government of the United States, through
its representative, E. George Squier, became concerned.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_696' name='Page_696' href='#Page_696'>696</a></span>
This arrangement gave rise to complications with
Great Britain, which were finally settled by the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty to perpetually guarantee the neutrality
of the canal to be constructed. The contractors
failed to carry out their agreement as regarded the
construction of a canal, but established the Accessory
Transit Company, and by means of steamers on the
two oceans, and on the river San Juan and Lake
Nicaragua, rendered valuable service in the transportation
of passengers. The matter was given in detail,
in connection with the relations of that company with
the Nicaraguan government, including its history
from the date of the foundation till 1869, when it
ceased to exist. However, their engineer, O. Childs,
made a survey of the route for a canal in 1851, and
recommended one from the mouth of Lajas River
to Port Brito, traversing the Rio Grande Valley.<a name='FA_XXXIV-15' id='FA_XXXIV-15' href='#FN_XXXIV-15' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-15]</a>

No efforts have been spared ever since by Nicaragua
and American citizens to bring about the accomplishment
of the long-expected canal, under the
impression that it is the most desirable, feasible, and
least expensive route. The assistance of the United
States government has been solicited, and treaties
made to afford facilities, but the American congress
has thus far refused to do anything, except send commissions
to explore the several lines, and their reports
seem to be favorable.<a name='FA_XXXIV-18' id='FA_XXXIV-18' href='#FN_XXXIV-18' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-18]</a> The last treaty concluded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_698' name='Page_698' href='#Page_698'>698</a></span>
between the two governments with reference to a canal
was rejected by the United States senate. The last
survey made under the auspices of the American government
was that of Engineer Menocal, of the United
States navy, who, with other officers, visited Nicaragua
in January 1885. His report was presented in
November of that year. The plan of this commission
had been at first to convert the river San Juan above
its junction with the Sarapiqui into an extension of the
lake by constructing a dam 74 feet high, but it was
found impracticable. The proposed route extends
from San Juan del Norte to Brito. The total length
is 169.8 miles, of which 38.98 miles will be excavated
canal, and 130.82 navigation by Lake Nicaragua, the
river San Juan, the basin of the river San Francisco,
and seven locks. Lake Nicaragua will be connected
with the Pacific by a canal, and with the Atlantic by
slackwater navigation in the river San Juan, by a short
section of canal from the San Juan to the basin of the
San Francisco, by navigation through this basin, and
by a canal thence to the Caribbean Sea. The route
has been divided into three divisions, the western,
eastern, and middle.<a name='FA_XXXIV-19' id='FA_XXXIV-19' href='#FN_XXXIV-19' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-19]</a> The cost was carefully estimated,
including a contingent of 25 per cent, at $64,043,697.
De Lesseps is of opinion, however, that a
canal with locks would be inadequate to pass the traffic
that will frequent it, and would suffer from uncertainty
of sufficient water to supply the lockage and evaporation.<a name='FA_XXXIV-20' id='FA_XXXIV-20' href='#FN_XXXIV-20' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-20]</a>

senate to enter into negotiations with the Central
American states and New Granada, conducive to
treaties for the protection of Americans who might
attempt opening the communication between the two
oceans. A treaty was made by the United States
with New Granada on the 12th of December, 1846,
under which the latter guaranteed to the former "the
right of way or transit across the Isthmus of Panamá,
upon any modes of communication that now exist, or
that may be hereafter constructed." The United
States government on its part guaranteed to New
Granada the neutrality of the Isthmus, and the rights

The termini resolved on were Colon on the Atlantic,

of January, 1855. Its total length is 47 miles, 3,020
feet. The line is a single one, but has four very commodious
sidings; namely, Gatun, 7½ miles from Colon;
one near Barbacoas, 22 miles; one at Matachin, 30
miles; and one at the summit, 37 miles. There

to construct a canal for $17,500,000, being at the rate
of $250 per share. Adding other items, and interest

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_707' name='Page_707' href='#Page_707'>707</a></span>
Coban to the Polochic River. However, these projects,
so far as I know, have been, since President
Barrios' death, in abeyance. The Spanish court was
repeatedly urged to open communications between
Puerto Caballos and the bay of Fonseca.<a name='FA_XXXIV-41' id='FA_XXXIV-41' href='#FN_XXXIV-41' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-41]</a> Traffic
on mule-back was carried on between both seas in
colonial times; but what we know of the isthmus of
Honduras is derived from the surveys made by the
British Honduras Interoceanic Railway Company, and
reported by their agent, E. G. Squier. As a practicable
route for a ship canal, Honduras is out of the
question; but the construction of a railroad was begun
between Puerto Caballos or Cortés, on the Caribbean
Sea, and Amapala in the bay of Fonseca,<a name='FA_XXXIV-42' id='FA_XXXIV-42' href='#FN_XXXIV-42' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-42]</a> through
the valley of the Goascoran and Humuya rivers—232
miles. The road was graded, and a narrow-gauge
track was built from Port Cortés to San Pedro, of
about 37 miles in length. The work was suspended
in 1871, and abandoned in 1873. Civil disturbances
and lack of means have prevented its resumption.
Several franchises have been granted in later years
for continuing it; but nothing of a practical nature
has resulted.<a name='FA_XXXIV-43' id='FA_XXXIV-43' href='#FN_XXXIV-43' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-43]</a>

Salvador has no territory on the Atlantic slope.
She has a railroad between San Miguel and Port La
Union; another line is being built from Port Acajutla
to the heart of the coffee region of Santa Ana. It is
possible that in the future the republic may be placed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_708' name='Page_708' href='#Page_708'>708</a></span>
in communication, by railway, with the Atlantic,
through the territory of her neighbors.
</p>

<p>
In Nicaragua the line between Corinto and Chinandega,
and hence to Leon, was in operation in 1881-2.
The work steadily progressed. The western section
was opened to public service in 1884, connecting it with
the steam-ship line on the lake. Thus was Managua,
the capital, placed in rapid and cheap communication
by steam with Corinto, the chief port of the republic.
The whole line from Momotombo to Corinto was yielding
six and four fifths per cent on the capital invested.
In the eastern section the work was going on rapidly
at the end of 1884, and 20 miles to Masaya would
soon be finished. The government contemplated to
have a direct railway line from Villa de la Paz to
Managua, thus establishing a continuous communication
between Managua and Granada.<a name='FA_XXXIV-44' id='FA_XXXIV-44' href='#FN_XXXIV-44' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-44]</a>

Costa Rica, thus far, has three lines, or rather
divisions or sections; namely, the Central, running
between San Jose and the interior provinces, via
Cartago, Heredia, Alajuela, Tres Rios, and San Joaquin;
the Atlantic, from Limon to the interior, which
is the route through which most of the country's
foreign trade is carried on; and the Pacific which runs
from Puntarenas to Esparta.<a name='FA_XXXIV-45' id='FA_XXXIV-45' href='#FN_XXXIV-45' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-45]</a>

The question of interoceanic communication by

occupying, as it does, general attention, I have concluded

<span class="smcap">Ignorance respecting Darien.</span>—It is a very singular circumstance that
the coast of Darien, the first settled in America (Santa Maria having been
founded in 1509, and Acla in Caledonia Bay in 1514), within eighteen days'
steaming from England, close also to such frequented ports as Chagres,
Carthagena, and Kingston, Jamaica, should be at the present day as unknown
as the coasts of Patagonia or of New Guinea, and that the vast advantages of
this tract of country, for a canal, should have escaped the penetration of the
great Humboldt, who, after having examined all the maps in the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Depósito
Hidrográfico</span> of Madrid, appears to suggest the Chuquanaqua. He says:
'On the Pacific coast, also, the deep Golfo de San Miguel, into which falls
the Tuyra with its tributary, the Chuchunque, runs far into the Isthmus; the
river Chuchunque, too, in the upper part of its course, runs within sixteen
geographical miles of the Antillean shore of the Isthmus, westward of Cape
Tiburon.' <i>Views of Nature</i>, Potsdam, June 1849, p. 432 of Bohn's translation.
</p>

<p>
The Atrato route labors under the disadvantage of a bad harbor, on the
Pacific side, Cupica being of very small extent, and open to the <span class="smcap">s. w.</span>; and
the Atrato has a bar with only five feet of water on it, while the rise of tide
in the Gulf of Darien is only two feet.
</p>

<p>
The Chagres, or Limon Bay and Panama route, surveyed in 1829 by Col
Lloyd and M. Falmarc, under a commission from the Liberator, Simon Bolívar,
and subsequently by M. Garella, has such bad harbors that the idea of
a canal by that line has been totally abandoned.

The route from Chepo mouth to Mandinga Bay, proposed by Mr Evan Hopkins,<a name='FA_XXXIV-48' id='FA_XXXIV-48' href='#FN_XXXIV-48' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-48]</a>
who attempted to survey it in 1847, for the New Granada government,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_711' name='Page_711' href='#Page_711'>711</a></span>
although the narrowest line across the Isthmus, being only twenty-seven
miles across from Chepo to Carti, has the disadvantages of bad coasts, a very
high cordillera, of from 2,000 to 6,000 feet elevation, and a large population of
Indians.
</p>

<p>
The bar at the mouth of Chepo River is quite dry at low water, as is also a
sand bank which extends several miles out into the bay of Panamá; the part
of the Atlantic coast on the other side is beset with reefs, shoals, and kays,
and is dangerous of approach.
</p>

<p>
Capt Fitzroy, R. N., in his <i>Considerations upon the Great Isthmus of
Central America</i>, suggests a line from the upper course of the Tuyra to the
Atrato, or the coast of Darien above its mouth, as an improvement of the
route proposed by me; but this would be nearly twice the distance of the
Port Escocés, and gulf of San Miguel route; there would be the mountain
of Chacargun or the Sierra de Maly to cross, and should the canal
open into the Atrato, there would be the very formidable obstacle of the bar
to remove, while of the coast above the Atrato mouth, the <i>Columbian Navigator</i>
says: 'All this coast from Tarena Kays to Cape Tiburon is high and
precipitous, with deep water off it; and it is very wild in the season of the
breezes. It is very advisable, therefore, at these seasons, to shun it.' Any
route, however, in this direction, would be included in the privilege granted,
on the 1st of June, 1852, by the New Granada government, to Edward Cullen,
Charles Fox, John Henderson, and Thomas Brassey, for cutting a canal
from Port Escocés to the gulf of San Miguel, which gives power to select
any place from the west mouth of the Atrato to Punta Mosquitos, for the
Atlantic entrance of the canal.

DISCOVERY OF THE SAVANA RIVER.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Discovery of the Savana River and the Route for the Ship-canal.</span>
I imagine that the river Savana was not delineated in the maps which Humboldt
saw.<a name='FA_XXXIV-49' id='FA_XXXIV-49' href='#FN_XXXIV-49' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-49]</a> Such, indeed, was the case with the map which I had on my
first journey into Darien in 1849, so that I was totally ignorant of its existence
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_712' name='Page_712' href='#Page_712'>712</a></span>
until I actually saw it, after entering Boca Chica, when, finding the
great depth of water at its mouth, and that it flowed almost directly from the
north, I became convinced that I had at last found the object of my search,
viz., a feasible route to the Atlantic, and thereupon immediately ascended it,
and crossed from Cañasas to the sea-shore at Port Escocés and back, and
subsequently, in 1850 and also in 1851, crossed and recrossed, at several times
and by several tracks, the route from the Savana to Port Escocés and Caledonia
Bay, notching the barks of the trees as I went along, with a <i>machete</i> or
cutlass, always alone and unaided, and always in the season of the heaviest
rains. I had previously examined, on my way from Panamá, the mouths of
Chepo, Chiman, Congo, and several other rivers, but found them all obstructed
by bars and sand banks, and impracticable for a ship passage, so that upon
seeing the Savana, I had not the least hesitation in deciding that that must
be the future route for interoceanic communication for ships.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">The Darien Canal Route.</span>—Port Escocés, or Scotch Harbor, and the bay
of Caledonia, on the Atlantic coast of the Isthmus of Darien, present an
extent of six nautical miles, from <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> to <span class="smcap">n. w.</span>, of safe anchorage in all
winds. These harbors are situated between Carreto Bay and the channel of
Sassardi, and are 140 miles <span class="smcap">e. s. e.</span> of Limon Bay, and twenty-one miles
<span class="smcap">w. n. w.</span> of Cape Tiburon, the <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> boundary of the Gulf of Darien. Port
Escocés extends to the <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> to lat. 8° 50´ and long. 77° 41´; and Golden Island,
or Isla de Oro, or Santa Catalina, which forms the <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> boundary of Caledonia
Bay, is in lat. 8° 54´ 40´´, and long. 77° 45´ 30´´.
</p>

<p>
The channel of Sassardi, also, extending from Caledonia Bay <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> five
miles to the Fronton, or point of Sassardi, is sheltered from the winds and
seas of both seasons, and has good depth of water.
</p>

<p>
Twenty-two miles <span class="smcap">s. w.</span> of Port Escocés is the site of the old Spanish settlement
of Fuerte del Príncipe, on the river Savana, established in 1785, and
abandoned in 1790. From thence the river Savana has nearly a <span class="smcap">s.</span> by <span class="smcap">e.</span>
course for fourteen miles to its mouth, which opens into the river Tuyra,
Santa Maria, or Rio Grande del Darien, three miles above Boca Chica and
Boca Grande, the two mouths by which the latter discharges itself into the
Gulf of San Miguel on the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Thus the distance from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, by the route
from Port Escocés or Caledonia Bay, to the gulf of San Miguel, by way of
the river Savana, would be thirty-nine miles. In a direct line, from Port
Escocés to the gulf, the distance is thirty-three miles.
</p>

<p>
In <i>Considerations on the Great Isthmus of Central America</i>, read before
the Royal Geographical Society of London, on the 11th and 25th Nov., 1850,
Captain Fitzroy, R. N., says: 'Any route that could be made available between
San Miguel Gulf and Caledonia Bay, or the Gulf of Darien or Choco,
would have the advantage of excellent harbors at each end, and a great
rise of tide in one of them (San Miguel). The river Savana is recommended
by Dr Cullen from personal examination, as being more navigable (for
canoes<a name='FA_XXXIV-50' id='FA_XXXIV-50' href='#FN_XXXIV-50' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-50]</a>), and approaching nearer the north coast than the Chuquanaqua
does; though this does not appear in the Spanish maps. From the head of
the Savana, a ravine, about three leagues in length, extends to Caledonia
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_713' name='Page_713' href='#Page_713'>713</a></span>
Bay, and there (Dr Cullen says, having passed through it) <i>he</i> thinks a canal
might be cut with less difficulty than elsewhere, if it were not for the opposition
of the natives. He also speaks of the Indians transporting their canoes
across at this ravine, and of the comparative healthiness of this part of the
Isthmus.'
</p>

<p>
The whole work to be done, in order to make a ship-canal communication
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by this route, would be to cut from
Príncipe or from Lara mouth to Port Escocés or Caledonia Bay, a distance
of from twenty-two to twenty-five miles, of which there would be but three
or four miles of deep cutting.
</p>

<p>
The canal, to be on a scale of grandeur commensurate with its important
uses, should be cut sufficiently deep to allow the tide of the Pacific to flow
right through it, across to the Atlantic; so that ships bound from the Pacific
to the Atlantic would pass with the flood, and those from the Atlantic to the
Pacific with the ebb tide of the latter. Such was the plan recommended in
my report to Lord Palmerston. By such a canal—that is, one entirely without
locks—the transit from sea to sea could be effected in six hours, or one
tide.<a name='FA_XXXIV-51' id='FA_XXXIV-51' href='#FN_XXXIV-51' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-51]</a>
</p>

<p>
For the engineering details, and estimates of the cost of the work, I beg
to refer to the valuable report of Mr. Lionel Gisborne, C. E., who, with his
assistant, Mr. Forde, was commissioned, last April, by Messrs Fox, Henderson,
and Brassey, to survey this route, which they found to be perfectly feasible
for a ship-canal communication, and fully as eligible as I had represented it.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_714' name='Page_714' href='#Page_714'>714</a></span>
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
PASSAGE FOR THE PACIFIC TIDE.
</p>

<p>
It is needless to say that, under the auspices of Messrs. Fox, Henderson,
and Brassey, who, with that clear discernment and prompt decision, which
have placed them in the elevated position which they occupy, adopted this
route in December 1851, after a careful examination of my statements, the
great work of an interoceanic canal is sure, erelong, to be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
I trust that an attentive consideration of the advantages of this route—viz.,
its shortness, the excellence of its harbors, the low elevation of the land,
the absence of bars at the Savana and Tuyra mouths, the depth of water and
great rise of tide in the former, its directness of course and freedom from obstructions,
the healthiness of the adjacent country, the exemption of the
coasts from northers and hurricanes, the feasibility of cutting a canal without
locks, and the absence of engineering difficulties—will fully justify me in asserting
it to be the shortest, the most direct, safe, and expeditious, and in
every way the most eligible route for intermarine communication for large
ships.
</p>

<p>
An examination of the physical aspect of the country from Port Escocés
to the Savana—presenting, as it does, but a single ridge of low elevation, and
this broken by gorges, ravines, and valleys, and grooved by rivers and
streams, with a champaign country extending from its base on each side—will
prove the feasibility of making the canal entirely without locks, a superiority
which this route possesses over others, which all present insurmountable
physical obstacles to the construction of such a canal.
</p>

<p>
In fact, a glance at the map ought to convince the most sceptical that nature
has unmistakably marked out this space for the junction of the two
oceans, and the breaking of the continuity of North and South America; indeed,
so narrow is the line of division, that it would almost appear as if the
two seas did once meet here.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Details of the Route Proposed.</span>—I shall now enter into a more detailed
description of this route, which I discovered in 1849, and proposed for a ship-canal
communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans in the <i>Panamá
Echo</i> of February 8, 1850, in the <i>Daily News</i> and <i>Mining Journal</i> of May
1850;<a name='FA_XXXIV-52' id='FA_XXXIV-52' href='#FN_XXXIV-52' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-52]</a> in a paper presented to the Royal Geographical Society, and read at
the Edinburgh meeting of the British Association in July 1850; and in a report
to Lord Palmerston, of January 15, 1851.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Port Escocés.</span>—Of Port Escocés, Caledonia Bay, and the channel of
Sassardi, the <i>Columbian Navigator</i>, vol. 3, p. 218, says:
</p>

<p>
'Port Escocés, or Caledonia, lat. 8° 51´, long. 77° 44´, is a noble harbor;
very safe, and so extensive that a thousand sail of vessels may enter it.
</p>

<p>
'Punta Escocés is the <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> point of Caledonia Bay, the greater islet of
Santa Catalina, or de Oro (gold), being the <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> Between point and point
the distance is four miles, and the points lie <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> and <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> (<span class="smcap">n.</span> 40° <span class="smcap">w.</span>, and
<span class="smcap">s.</span> 40° <span class="smcap">e.</span>), from each other; and in respect to this line the bay falls in one
mile and two thirds. In the <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> part of this bay is Puerto Escocés (or Scottish
Harbor), which extends inward two miles in that direction, and forms
good shelter. There are various shoals in it, which are represented in the
particular plan of the harbor, by which plan any vessel may run in, for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_715' name='Page_715' href='#Page_715'>715</a></span>
depths are five, six, seven, and eight fathoms of water over a bottom of
sand.
</p>

<p>
'Between Piedras Islet to the north, the west point of Aglatomate River
to the south, and that of San Fulgencio to the S. W., is formed the Ensenada,
or bay of Caledonia, and the channel of Sassardi.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Caledonia Bay.</span>—'The Ensenada, or cove of Caledonia, is, strictly
speaking, formed by the points already mentioned, which lie with each other
<span class="smcap">n. n. w.</span> ¾ <span class="smcap">w.</span>, and <span class="smcap">s. s. e.</span> ¾ <span class="smcap">e.</span> (<span class="smcap">n.</span> 25° <span class="smcap">w.</span>, and <span class="smcap">s.</span> 25° <span class="smcap">e.</span>), one mile distant. This
bay is clean, and has good deep water; the greater part of its coast is a beach,
and near the middle of it disembogues the river Aglaseniqua. The point of
San Fulgencio is salient, scarped, and clean, and it also forms an indent with
little depth of water, bordered by mangroves and various kays at its western
part.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">The Channel of Sassardi.</span>—'Between San Fulgencio point, the great Oro
Island, Piedras Islet, and the Mangrove Kays, which are to the west of them,
the channel of Sassardi is formed; the <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> entrance to this channel is off and
on, with four cables' length in extent, from edge to edge, and with from nine
to twelve fathoms depth on oaze; and farther in, from eight to ten fathoms;
as also between the turn of the bank off Piedras Islet, and the bay of Caledonia,
the depth is from seven to fifteen fathoms; and the piece of sea which
intervenes between this bay and the Puerto Escocés is of a good depth of
water; but at a short mile <span class="smcap">s. e.</span> by <span class="smcap">e.</span> ½ <span class="smcap">e.</span> (<span class="smcap">s.</span> 55° <span class="smcap">e.</span>), from Piedras Islet the
sea breaks when the breeze blows fresh.'
</p>

<p>
From its entrance the channel of Sassardi extends <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> five miles.
</p>

<p>
The engineer has here, then, a wide scope for selecting a locality for the
Atlantic mouth of the canal, which may thus open anywhere from the <span class="smcap">s. e.</span>
end of Port Escocés to the <span class="smcap">n. w.</span> entrance of the Channel of Sassardi, an
extent of eleven nautic. miles.
</p>

<p>
Along a great extent of Port Escocés and Caledonia Bay, vessels can lie
so close in shore that no boats would be necessary in the taking in or discharging
cargo; the same great advantage also presents itself at several
points in the channel of Sassardi.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
SOURCES OF FRESH WATER.
</p>

<p>
Good fresh water may be obtained in abundance from any of the numerous
streams which fall into these harbors, particularly from the Aglaseniqua or
Aglatomate.
</p>

<p>
Port Escocés is entirely uninhabited, nor is there any settlement in and of
it; at Caledonia, near the mouth of the Aglaseniqua, there are five huts, inhabited
by a few Indians of the Tule tribe, and about two leagues up the
river is another small settlement; this, however, is at a considerable distance
westward of the projected line of canal.
</p>

<p>
From the sea-shore a plain extends for nearly two miles to the base of a
ridge of hills, which runs parallel to the coast, and whose highest summit is
about 350 feet. This ridge is not quite continuous and unbroken, but is
divided by transverse valleys, through which the Aglaseniqua, Aglatomate,
and other rivers have their course, and whose highest elevations do not exceed
150 feet.
</p>

<p>
The base of this ridge is only two miles in width; and from its south side
a level plain extends for thirteen miles to a point on the river Savana, called
Cañasas, which is about twenty miles above its mouth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_716' name='Page_716' href='#Page_716'>716</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The river Savana, at Cañasas, has a depth of six feet of water, but is obstructed
by ledges of a slate, called <i>pizarra</i>, or <i>killes</i>, for four miles, down to
the mouth of La Villa, up to which the tide reaches. At Cañasas, there is
a forest of a species of bamboo, so dense as to be impenetrable; and above it
there is a fall of two feet, when the river is low, but after rains this entirely
disappears. The first fall, in ascending the river, occurs at Caobano, a little
above La Villa.
</p>

<p>
From La Villa, where there is a depth of ten or twelve feet, the river is
perfectly free from obstructions down to Príncipe.
</p>

<p>
At Fuerte del Príncipe, two miles below La Villa, there is a single ledge
of slate, visible only in a very low state of the river, which has here a depth
of three fathoms, and a rise of tide of six feet. The banks of the river are
elevated about ten feet above the level of the water, and are quite free from
swamp. The site of the old Spanish settlement is here indicated by a patch
of very dense scrubby bush, without high trees, on the west bank of the
river; but the only remains to be met with are some fragments of <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">botijas</span></i>, or
water-jars. Príncipe is in lat. 8° 34', and long. 77° 56', by my observations;
it is only two or three hours' journey from the mouth of the river.
</p>

<p>
The Savana River, called by the Indians Chaparti, is very direct in its
course, from Príncipe to its mouth, and free from sinuosities, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">playas</span></i>, deep
elbows, shoals, rocks, snags, or other obstructions.
</p>

<p>
Its banks, elevated several feet above the level of the water, are quite free
from swamp and malarious miasmata, consequently the endemic fevers caused
by these in Chagres, Portobello, Limon, and Panama, would not prevail in
any settlements that may be formed in the neighborhood of the Savana.
Indeed, it cannot be inferred that the Isthmus of Darien is unhealthy,
because the towns on the Isthmus of Panama have all been settled in swampy
localities, and in the most unfavorable positions in a sanatory point of view.
A convincing proof of the freedom from swamp of the whole tract of country,
from Port Escocés to the gulf of San Miguel, is the total absence of
musquitoes, which invariably infest all swampy grounds in the tropics. The
great longevity of the people of Darien, and the large proportion of very old
men, also attest the healthiness of the climate.
</p>

<p>
From Príncipe to the mouth of Matumaganti, one mile <span class="smcap">s. s. w.</span>, the river
increases greatly in width and depth; there are some islands in this reach;
and on the west bank a very large cuipo-tree stands conspicuous, towering
above the adjacent forest.
</p>

<p>
From Matumaganti to the mouth of Lara, two miles, the river has a
depth of four fathoms, and a rise of tide of ten feet.
</p>

<p>
From Lara mouth to the islands in the second reach, four miles, the river
is very direct in its course, with a depth of five or six fathoms. A ridge of
hills runs parallel to each bank, at about two miles' distance. Just below
this mouth, and above a widening of the river, called Revesa de Piriaki, is
Cerro Piriaki, a hill of about 400 feet elevation, and above this there is no
hill near either bank of the Savana. Above the islands, Estero Corotu, Rio
Corredor, and other streams fall into this, the Calle Larga, or Long Reach.
</p>

<p>
From the islands to Areti mouth, <span class="smcap">s. s. e.</span>, three miles, the river has great
width and depth; a ridge of hill here runs along each bank, at about two
miles' distance.

8° 21', long. 77° 54', the land rises into a ridge of hills of about 309 feet elevation,
running <span class="smcap">n.</span> for about four miles parallel to the river, from which it is
separated by a strip of level land half a mile wide. There is a <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">quebrada</span>, or
rivulet, in the ridge, called Laguadilla, which has plenty of fresh water in the
driest season.
</p>

<p>
Behind Nisperal, the east point of the Savana mouth, there is a low ridge
of hills; from the north bank of Iglesias, also, a narrow ridge follows the
course of the Savana for about three miles. This is the Cerro Titichi, which
gave its name to a mission of Indians at the mouth of the Chuquanaqua, the
last survivor of whom is a man named Marcellino, who resides at Pinogana,
on the Tuyra. On the north bank of Iglesias is Quebrada de Tigre, and on
the Savana, above its mouth, is Quebradita la Monera, where fresh water
may be obtained.
</p>

<p>
At the mouth of the Savana there are nine fathoms, at low water, and the
tide rises from twenty-one to twenty-seven feet.
</p>

<p>
Boca Chica and Boca Grande, the mouths of the Tuyra, are perfectly safe
entrances, and have a depth of thirteen to twenty fathoms of water respectively.
</p>

<p>
The gulf of San Miguel has good depth of water, and would hold the shipping
of the world. Its mouth, between Cape San Lorenzo on the north, and
Punta Garachiné on the south, is ten miles across, and opens into the Pacific,
quite outside the bay of Panama. Its direction inward is <span class="smcap">n. e.</span> fifteen miles
to Boca Chica. Inside the bay of Garachiné, the shores of the gulf approach
each other, and the width diminishes to four miles, between Punta Brava
and Morro Patiño, with a depth of from nine to twenty fathoms, but again
increases, and then diminishes to Boca Chica.
</p>

<p>
Close to Cape San Lorenzo is a small shoal, called El Buey, which may be
easily avoided. There are several islands in the gulf, as Iguana, Cedro, Islas
de San Diego, etc., etc., which are all safe of approach. On the north side,
the rivers Congo, Buenavista; and on the south the Moguey, Guaca, Taimita,
and Sambú, open into the gulf; while the Tuyra and Savana fall into its
eastern end, the Ensenada del Darien, called by the Granadians 'Boca de
Provincia,' or Mouth of the Province. <i>Cullen's Isth. of Darien.</i>

From what has been said, it sufficiently appears that Nicaragua is a country
of great beauty of scenery and vast natural resources. She has, however,
attracted the attention of the world less on these accounts than because she
is believed to possess within her borders the best and most feasible route for
a ship-canal between the two great oceans. The project of opening such a
canal began to be entertained as soon as it was found that there existed no
natural communication between the seas, as early as 1527. Since that period
it has furnished a subject for much speculation, but beyond a few partial
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_718' name='Page_718' href='#Page_718'>718</a></span>
examinations, until very lately, nothing of a practical or satisfactory character
had been attempted. In 1851 a careful survey was made of the river
San Juan, Lake Nicaragua, and the isthmus intervening between this lake
and the Pacific, by Colonel O. W. Childs, previously engineer-in-chief of the
state of New York, under the direction of the now extinct Atlantic and
Pacific Ship-canal Company. Until then, it had always been assumed that
the river San Juan, as well as the lake itself, could easily be made navigable
for ships, and that the only obstacle to be overcome was the narrow strip of
land between the lake and the ocean. Hence, all the so-called surveys were
limited to an examination of that part of the line. One of them was made
under the orders of the Spanish government, by Don Manuel Galisteo, in 1781;
another, and that best known, by Mr. John Baily, under the direction of the
government of Central America, in 1838. An intermediate examination,
quoted by Thompson,<a name='FA_XXXIV-53' id='FA_XXXIV-53' href='#FN_XXXIV-53' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-53]</a> seems to have been made early in the present century.

As the survey of Colonel Childs is the only one which can be accepted as
conforming to modern engineering requirements, it will be enough to present
the detailed results to which he arrived. The line proposed by him, and on
which all his calculations and estimates were based, commences at the little
port of Brito, on the Pacific, and passes across the Isthmus, between the
ocean and lake, to the mouth of a small stream called Rio Lajas, flowing into
the latter, thence across Lake Nicaragua to its outlet, and down the valley
of the Rio San Juan to the port of the same name on the Atlantic. The
length of this line was found to be 194⅓ miles, as follows:

<span class="smcap">Origin of the Canal Grant.</span>—The charter of this company under
which Colonel Childs carried on his investigations is dated September 22,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_719' name='Page_719' href='#Page_719'>719</a></span>
1849, and was obtained for a term of eighty-five years from the completion
of the proposed canal. The surveys were to be commenced within one year,
and the whole to be completed in twelve years. The canal, by the terms of
the charter, was to be of dimensions sufficiently great to admit and pass vessels
of all sizes with speed and safety. The company was to pay to the state,
during the period assigned for the construction of the work, the annual sum
of $10,000; to give to the state $200,000 of stock in the canal, on the issue
of stock; the state to receive, for the first twenty years, twenty per cent
annually out of the net profits of the canal, after deducting the interest on
the capital actually invested, at the rate of seven per cent; and for the remaining
sixty-five years, twenty-five per cent of the profits. The company,
on the other hand, were to receive fifteen per cent annually out of the net
profits of the canal for the first ten years after it should revert to the state,
provided it did not cost over $20,000,000; but if it should cost more than
that sum, the company to receive twenty per cent for twenty years. During
the period of constructing the canal (twelve years), the company had the
exclusive right of navigating the waters of the state by steam, and also the
privilege of opening a transit route through its territories, upon the principal
condition of paying ten per cent of the net profits to the state. There were
some other provisions as to lands, tolls, etc., of no special importance.
</p>

<p>
Under this charter, the company perfected its organization. It divided its
original shares into a considerable number, called 'canal rights,' which
were sold, and their holders brought into the organization. The first instalment
was paid, and in August 1850, just in time to meet the stipulation
providing that the surveys should be commenced within one year from the
date of the contract, a party of surveyors was sent out to Nicaragua. They
were under the direction (as already said) of Colonel O. W. Childs as chief
engineer. He arrived in Nicaragua on the 27th of August, 1850, and so far
as his report is concerned, we are left to infer that he at once commenced
the surveys for the canal. His report is dated March 9, 1852.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
DIVERSIONS OF THE CANAL.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">The Line of Survey.</span>—In the various projects for uniting the two seas,
the line of the river San Juan has always been contemplated as that by which
the great lake of Nicaragua is to be reached. From that lake to the Pacific,
various routes have been suggested:
</p>

<p>
1. From Lake Nicaragua via the river Sapoa to the bay of Bolaños, in the
gulf of Salinas, on the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
2. Via the Rio Lajas to the port of San Juan del Sur, or some point not far
from it, on the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
3. Via the Rio Tipitapa into the superior lake of Managua, and from this
lake to the Pacific at the little port of Tamarindo, the port of Realejo, or into
the magnificent gulf or bay of Fonseca.
</p>

<p>
By his instructions, Colonel Childs was limited to a survey of the direct
routes from Lake Nicaragua to the Pacific, provided either of them should
prove practicable. As a consequence, finding a route which, in his opinion,
was practicable, he made no surveys from the superior lake of Managua to
the Pacific. He, however, made some observations on the line of the connection
between the two lakes by the river Tipitapa—if a channel dry for
most, if not all, of the year can be called a river. This is a source of great
regret, especially in view of the deficiency, on the surveyed routes, of a good
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_720' name='Page_720' href='#Page_720'>720</a></span>
harbor on the Pacific, while both Realejo and the gulf of Fonseca are all that
can be desired as ports.
</p>

<p>
Lake Nicaragua is estimated by Colonel Childs to be one hundred and ten
miles in extreme length by thirty-five in (average) width. Its nearest approach
to the Atlantic is at its southern extremity, from which, on a right
line, it is about eighty miles distant. The point of its nearest approach to
the Pacific is near the middle of its length, where, by the shortest line, the
distance is about eleven miles.
</p>

<p>
The San Juan River was found by Colonel Childs to be, following its
sinuosities, 119 miles in length. It has a great number of tributaries, generally
small, with the exception of the San Cárlos and Serapiqui, which come
in from the mountains of Costa Rica on the south. The first of these enters
the San Juan at sixty-five miles, and the second ninety miles below the lake.
These streams flow through valleys transversely to that of the San Juan,
which is further intersected by ranges of hills, coming in both from the north
and the south, at the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rapides del Toro</span>, Castillo, Machuca, etc.
</p>

<p>
The lake of Nicaragua lies longitudinally, nearly parallel to the Pacific
Ocean, and is separated from it, for nearly two thirds of the length of the
lake, by hills of comparatively moderate acclivity and elevation, in most
cases capable of cultivation to their summits. Within this distance, also,
are several transverse valleys, extending nearly (Colonel Childs says quite)
across, with summits varying in height, and furnishing generally good opportunities
for direct communications by ordinary roads or by canal.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Route via River Sapoa.</span>—This line lies chiefly in the department of
Guanacaste, now in dispute between Nicaragua and Costa Rica, and actually
occupied by the latter.
</p>

<p>
The examination of this line by Colonel Childs only proved its impracticability
for the purpose of a canal. He found that to pass the summit a cut
119 feet in depth would be required, and an up-lockage from the lake of 350½
feet, and a down-lockage to the Pacific of 432 feet. Water to supply the
upper locks, it was ascertained, could only be obtained with difficulty, and
at great cost. Besides, a long rock cut of three fourths of a mile would be
required from low-tide mark in the bay of Salinas to deep water. In short,
the physical difficulties on this line, if not of a nature to make the construction
of a canal impossible, were nevertheless such as to make it impracticable.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Route from Mouth of the Rio Lajas to Brito.</span>—The line from Lake
Nicaragua to the Pacific, to which public attention has been most directed,
is one starting from the mouth of the Rio Lajas, a few miles below the town
of Rivas, or Nicaragua, to the port of San Juan del Sur, or Concordia, on the
Pacific. As already stated, not less than three surveys had been made over
this line; one in 1781 by Galisteo, a Spanish engineer, and the last by Mr.
Baily, an Englishman, under the republic of Central America, published in
Stephens' <i>Incidents of Travel in Central America</i>. The line pursued by
both Galisteo and Baily was governed by the circumstance of a measurably
good port on the Pacific—that of San Juan del Sur, the best on the whole
line of coast from the bay of Salinas northward to Realejo. Baily's line is
sixteen miles and 730 feet in length, and the greatest elevation above the
lake 487 feet. That of Galisteo is seventeen miles 200 feet in length, and
the greatest elevation above the sea 272, and above the lake 134 feet. Baily's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_721' name='Page_721' href='#Page_721'>721</a></span>
line, for half of its distance, involved 209 feet of average vertical cutting;
that of Galisteo, for half of its length, an average vertical cutting of 108 feet.
These facts, and others, among which the absolute impossibility of supplying
the summit levels with water, and the necessity of tunnels, combined to
make the construction of a canal on this line wholly impossible.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
EXPLORING FOR A LINE.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs seems to have been satisfied of the impracticability of this
line, after a very rapid examination, and to have devoted himself to the discovery
of one more feasible. In doing this, however, it was found necessary
to abandon San Juan del Sur as the western terminus.
</p>

<p>
Starting at the point on the lake to the eastward of Rivas, levelling westward,
through a transverse, moderately undulating plain, he ascended, on a
distance of six and a half miles, 326 feet, to the summit of a broad valley,
passing between the hills (which are here of moderate height), and connecting
with another valley on the west side, which extends to a place on the
Pacific called Brito, where a stream, named Rio Grande, flows into the sea.
The quantity of water available for this summit being entirely inadequate,
and the cut altogether too formidable, on the plan of carrying through the
level, this route was abandoned. Another line, not far from this, was attempted,
with very nearly the same result.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs next started from the mouth of the Rio Lajas, the same
point with his predecessors, and carried a line of levels to the summit of a
transverse valley lying about six and a half miles south of Rivas, and reaching
between the valley of Rio Lajas and that of the Rio Grande, already
mentioned as flowing into the Pacific at Brito. This summit was found to be
only forty-seven and a half feet above the surface of the lake, as it stood on
the 23d day of December, 1850, at which time it was three and a half feet
above its lowest stages, and one and a half feet below the level at which it
ordinarily stands at the height of the rainy season. The length of this line
from lake to sea is about twenty miles. This is the route, and the only
direct one, between the lake and sea, regarded by Colonel Childs as feasible,
and upon this all his calculations respecting the proposed canal are
based. In his own language: 'The conclusion was arrived at that the line
leading from the lake, at the mouth of the river Lajas to the Pacific at
Brito, presented more favorable conditions for the construction of the canal
than any other; it was therefore determined to survey and carefully to locate
a line across upon this route.'
</p>

<p>
This line, then, runs through the valley of the river Lajas, the waters of
a principal branch of which interlock with those of the Rio Grande, and,
through the valley of the latter, reaches the sea. The stream first named
has its origin about ten miles south-westerly from its entrance into the lake,
on the eastern slope of the dividing ridge, and after running north-westerly
two miles, along the base of the hills, takes a northerly direction through
comparatively level savannas, a distance of six miles or eight miles, when it
bends to the east, and in a mile and three fourths enters the lake. The Rio
Grande rises on the eastern slope of the same range of hills, and two or three
miles north-west from the sources of the Lajas, and, after flowing some three
or four miles at the foot of their slope, bends to the west, and by a narrow
and somewhat irregular valley passes through the ridge, and thence, in a
more capacious and uniform valley, into the Pacific.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_722' name='Page_722' href='#Page_722'>722</a></span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Western Section of Proposed Canal between Lake Nicaragua and
the Pacific.</span>—The entire line of the canal proposed by Colonel Childs, and
upon which all his calculations and estimates are based, is therefore through
the valley of the river San Juan into Lake Nicaragua, across Lake Nicaragua
to the mouth of the Rio Lajas, through the valley of that stream, and
across the summit of forty-seven and a half feet which separates it from that
of the Rio Grande, and down the valley of the Rio Grande to Brito, where
that stream enters the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
Now, in order to understand Colonel Childs' conclusions, and appreciate
the data which he gives, we must know what kind of a work he proposes.
He contemplates a canal but seventeen feet deep; and as he intends to supply
the western section, from the lake to the sea, by water from the lake, it
would be necessary to commence construction in the lake at a point where
the water is seventeen feet deep at mean stage. This point is opposite the
mouth of the Lajas, and twenty-five chains from the line of the shore. From
this point, for a mile and a half, partially along the river Lajas, the excavation
will be principally earth; but beyond this, for a distance of five and a
half miles, which carries the line beyond the summit, three fourths of the excavation
will be in a trap rock. That is to say, the deepest excavation, or
open cut, will be sixty-five feet, and involve the removal of 1,879,000 cubic
yards of earth, and 3,378,000 cubic yards of rock. The excavation and construction
in this five and a half miles alone are estimated at upward of
$6,000,000.
</p>

<p>
The summit passed, and the valley of the Rio Grande reached, the excavation,
as a general rule, will be only the depth of the canal. Colonel Childs
found that the lake, at ordinary high water, is only 102 feet 10 inches above
the Pacific at high and 111 feet 5 inches above it at low tide, instead of 128
feet, as calculated by Mr. Baily. This descent he proposes to accomplish by
fourteen locks, of eight feet lift each, placed at proper points in the valley of
the Rio Grande, thus bringing us to Brito, the terminus on the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
The harbor of Brito, as it is called, or the point where the Rio Grande
enters the sea, is at best only a bad anchorage. There is here a small angular
indentation of the land, partially protected by a low ledge of rock, but
nothing adequate for the terminus of an important work like the proposed
canal, or capable of answering the commonest requisites of a port. To remedy
this deficiency, Colonel Childs proposed to construct an artificial harbor,
of thirty-four acres area, by means of moles and jetties in the sea, and by
extensive excavations in the land. If, as he supposes, the excavations here
would be in sand, it is obviously almost impossible to get proper foundations
for the immense sea-walls and piers that would be necessary for a work of
this kind. On the contrary, if these excavations should be chiefly in a rock,
as seems most likely, the cost and labor would almost surpass computation.
Assuming the excavations for the purpose to be in earth and sand, Colonel
Childs estimates the cost of making a harbor at a little over $2,600,000.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Middle Section of Proposed Canal—Lake Nicaragua.</span>—Proceeding
from seventeen feet depth of water in the lake, opposite to the river Lajas,
in the direction of the outlet of the lake at Fort San Cárlos, there is ample
water for vessels of all sizes for a distance of about fifty-one miles, to a point
half a mile south of the Boacos Islands. Here the depth of water diminishes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_723' name='Page_723' href='#Page_723'>723</a></span>
rapidly to fourteen feet. For the remaining five and a half miles to the fort,
the water is variable, averaging only about nine feet at low and about fourteen
at high water. For this distance of five and a half miles, therefore, an
average under-water excavation of eight feet would be required to make the
channel, at low water, of the depth of the canal, or seventeen feet. But if
the lake were kept at high level, the under-water excavation would be but an
average of three feet.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs proposed to protect this portion of the channel by rows of
piles driven on each side, along its whole extent, and thinks, after the excavation
were made, a sufficient current would be established to keep the
channel clear.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
THE RIVER SAN JUAN.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Eastern Section—The River San Juan.</span>—We come now to the section
between Lake Nicaragua and the Atlantic, through or along the river San
Juan. Excepting a small settlement at the Castillo Viejo, at the Castillo
Rapids, thirty-seven miles from the lake, the valley of the San Juan is wholly
uninhabited. This section, hitherto supposed the easiest, is, nevertheless, by
far the most difficult part of the proposed enterprise.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs carried a line of levels from the lake at San Cárlos to the
port of San Juan, on the northern bank of the stream. The whole distance
from San Carlos to seventeen feet depth of water in the harbor of San Juan
is 119⅓ miles; and the whole fall, from the surface of high lake to the surface
of highest tide in the harbor, is 107½ feet—to lowest tide, 108¾ feet.
</p>

<p>
Of the above distance, the first ninety-one miles, or from San Carlos to
half a mile below the Serapiqui River, Colonel Childs proposed to make the
river navigable by excavating its bed, and by constructing dams, to be passed
by means of locks and short canals; the remaining twenty-eight miles of the
canal to be constructed inland, or independently of the river. Of the whole
fall, sixty-two and a half feet occurs on that portion which it is proposed to
improve by dams, and on which there were to be eight locks, and the remaining
forty-six and a quarter feet occurs on the inland portion of the canal, on
which were to be six locks—fourteen locks in all.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs proposed to place the first dam at the head of the Castillo
Rapids, a distance of upward of thirty-seven miles from the lake, and to pass
the rapids by means of a lateral canal. By means of this dam he proposed to
raise the water, at that point, twenty-one and a half feet, and the entire level
of Lake Nicaragua five feet above its lowest stages, or in other words, to
keep it at high-water mark. The fall at this dam would be sixteen feet. He
proposed also six other dams, four of eight feet fall, one of fourteen and a
half feet, and one of thirteen and a half feet. Between all of these there
would be more or less excavation in the bed of the stream, sometimes in
earth, and often in rock.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs proposed further to improve the harbor of San Juan by
moles, etc., and to construct an artificial harbor in connection with it of the
capacity of thirteen acres.
</p>

<p>
In respect of the amount of water in the San Juan, we have some interesting
statistics. This amount, of course, varies greatly with the different
seasons. The quantity of water that passed from the lake at its lowest stage,
on the 4th of June, 1851, was 11,930 cubic feet per second. The greatest
rise of the lake is about five feet. When it stood at 3.43 feet above its lowest
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_724' name='Page_724' href='#Page_724'>724</a></span>
level, the flow of water was 18,059 cubic feet per second, being an increase of
about fifty per cent. Supposing the same ratio of increase, at high lake the
amount of water in the river would be doubled.
</p>

<p>
The river receives large accessions from its tributaries. Below these, and
above the point of divergence of the Colorado, flowing direct into the sea
from the San Juan, which falls into the harbor of the same name, the flow
of water was 54,380 cubic feet per second, of which 42,056 passed through
the Colorado branch into the ocean, and 12,324 through the San Juan into
the port.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Dimensions of the Proposed Canal.</span>—Where the excavation is in earth,
Colonel Childs proposed (and all his estimates are founded on these dimensions)
that the canal shall have a depth of 17 feet; that it shall be 50 feet
wide at the bottom, 86 feet wide at 9 feet above the bottom, and 118 feet
wide at the surface of the water. Where the excavation is in rock, the canal
is to be 50 feet wide at bottom, 77 feet at 9 feet above bottom, and 78⅓ feet
at the surface of the water.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Length of Proposed Canal.</span>—The total length of the line proposed by
Colonel Childs, from San Juan del Norte on the Atlantic, to Brito on the
Pacific, is 194⅓ miles, as follows:

<p>
The canal company published a pamphlet, in which the estimates for the
canal were made at New York prices, and in which the total was put down
at $13,243,099. 'The prices adopted in the estimate of $31,500,000,' says
Colonel Childs, 'are made up with reference to the completion of the work
within six years from the time of breaking ground, and a commencement of
the settlement of the country in the vicinity of the line previous to letting
the contracts.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Capacity of the Proposed Canal.</span>—The charter of the canal company
provided that the capacity of the work should be sufficiently great 'to admit
vessels of all sizes.' And it is obvious that a work which will not pass freely
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_725' name='Page_725' href='#Page_725'>725</a></span>
the largest vessels can but imperfectly answer the purposes of its construction,
or meet the requirements of commerce. But Colonel Childs proposed
only one 17 feet deep, 50 feet wide at bottom, and 118 feet wide at top—a
capacity wholly inadequate to pass the larger classes of vessels, and one
which fails to meet the stipulations of the charter. The larger merchant-ships,
such as are generally employed in the eastern trade, have a draught
of from 20 to 25 feet, and would require, to say nothing of war vessels and
large steamers, a canal of from 25 to 30 feet in depth, which would involve
more than double the amount of excavation proposed, and probably treble
the amount of cost, and carry it up from $31,500,000 to $100,000,000. Here
is the fatal deficiency in the whole proposition of Colonel Childs.
</p>

<p>
To make the canal capable of passing vessels drawing 20 feet of water,
Colonel Childs says, would increase to a very great degree the amount of the
excavation on the river section, and still more the expense. 'Any considerable
increase in the depth proposed (17 feet) would require under-water excavations
between the lake and the Toro Rapids, a distance of 27 miles, to be
almost continuous; it would very much lengthen the cuts on the other portions
of the river, and the liability of these artificial channels to receive
deposits of earth to such an extent as to obstruct navigation would be very
much greater. On the inland portion of the canal,' continues Colonel Childs,
'a depth of 22 feet of water would, with fifty feet bottom-width, give a transverse
water-section about 45 per cent greater than a depth of 17 feet, with the
same bottom-width; and the expense of the inland portions would also, by
reason of the greater depth of excavation, be increased in a still higher ratio.'
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
THE VIEWS OF COLONEL CHILDS.
</p>

<p>
Colonel Childs seems sensible of the inadequacy of a canal of the proposed
dimensions, but thinks that by changes in model, etc., ships of great size
could be built to pass a 17-foot canal. That is to say, the world may build
ships for the canal, instead of the canal company a canal for the ships of the
world! He states that most steamers draw less than 17 feet, and quotes from
Murray's <i>Treatise on Marine Engines</i> to show that of 261 steam-vessels, principally
English, 15 draw over 17 feet, 21 have 17 feet draught, and 225 less
than 17 feet. But he neglects to tell us that experience and economy point
to the construction of larger steamers than those now in use, and that such
as would be used in the eastern trade, in the event of the construction of the
canal, would be still larger than those of the Collins line, which draw over
22 feet. Besides, a canal of 17 feet is only adequate to the passage of vessels
of 15 feet draught. No canal ought to be contemplated with a less depth
than 25 feet, and with proportionate top and bottom width.
</p>

<p>
The Chesapeake and Delaware Canal has a depth of 10 feet.
</p>

<p>
The Welland Canal is 28 miles long, 9 feet deep, 35 feet wide at bottom,
and 71 feet at top. It passes vessels of 350 tons.
</p>

<p>
The Caledonian Canal, between the eastern and western shores of Great
Britain, is 59 miles in length, of which 21½ miles is inland and 37½ through
lakes. It is 50 feet wide at bottom, 110 feet at top, and is 20 feet deep. It
is capable of passing frigates of 32 guns, and merchant-vessels of 1,000 tons.
</p>

<p>
The canal from Amsterdam to New Dieppe, in Holland, is 50 miles long,
36 feet wide at bottom and 124 at top, and is 20 feet 9 inches deep.
</p>

<p>
In respect of navigating the canal, according to Colonel Childs' suggestions,
steamers will propel themselves, and sail-vessels will be moved by tugs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_726' name='Page_726' href='#Page_726'>726</a></span>
constructed for the purpose, except on the portion west of the lake, and between
the river and port of San Juan, where the delay of the driving steamers
in passing the locks would make the use of animal-power advisable. Calculating
24 minutes as the time required for a vessel to pass each lock, 60 vessels,
it is calculated, could be passed in a day. The average rate of speed
with which steamers might safely move in the inland portions of the canal is
calculated at 2½ miles per hour, on the river portions 7 miles an hour, and
on the lake, 11 miles an hour. Sailing vessels propelled by horse-power might
move on the canal at the rate of two miles an hour, and on the river and lake
with an average speed of 4 miles per hour. For steamers, therefore, the passage
from sea to sea is estimated at 46½ hours, or about two days; for sailing
vessels, 77 hours, or 3¼ days.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Facilities for Constructing the Canal.</span>—There are many considerations
connected with an enterprise of this kind besides its feasibility in a
mere engineering point of view, such as labor, materials, etc., etc. To all of
these Colonel Childs seems to have devoted some attention.
</p>

<p>
<i>Timber.</i>—As compared with those of the United States, the original forests
of Nicaragua are inferior in size, and the kind and quantity of timber
proper for use less in proportion. The tree called the 'cedro,' or cedar, is
produced in considerable abundance, and can be usefully applied. It grows
to a great height, and will produce timber 36 to 40 feet long, and 12 to 18
inches square. The 'roble,' a species of oak, is also a tall tree, and furnishes
timber equal to the cedar in size. The '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">níspero</span>,' 'laurel,' 'madera negra,'
and others, answer a very good purpose. The '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">níspero</span>' is 29 per cent
stronger than white oak, and may be procured in sufficient quantities, in the
opinion of Colonel Childs, to be relied on as a substitute for all the purposes
in which oak is required. He thinks that, in the aggregate, the forests of
Nicaragua, in the sections traversed by the canal, will probably produce all
the lumber required.
</p>

<p>
<i>Stone.</i>—Along the river San Juan, the rock is chiefly trap, graywacke,
and shale; in many localities too friable for use, but in others, Colonel Childs
thinks, it may be found fit for the purposes required. On the west side of the
lake limestone quarries were found, capable of producing good lime in abundance.
The stone, generally, between the lake and Pacific, on the proposed
canal line, is not good, but it was thought that in case of need it might be
obtained from Granada, sixty miles to the north-west, and from a lower point
on the Isthmus. Very good and abundant clays were found, and a stone from
which water-lime of a fair quality may be obtained.
</p>

<p>
<i>Labor.</i>—Colonel Childs concedes that the prosecution of the works of the
canal would be attended with vast difficulties, resulting from a lack of all the
essential requisites in the shape of mills, roads, carriages, etc., etc. He thinks
the oxen of the country may be obtained in sufficient numbers to do all the
necessary hauling of materials. But there is yet a consideration of vastly
more importance, viz., labor. Colonel Childs apprehends that it would be
necessary to rely chiefly on foreigners. He says that, although the laboring
population of the country, when under compulsory circumstances, are capable
of great activity and of enduring much fatigue, in their ordinary avocations
they are tardy and irregular in their labor. An exception is, however,
made in favor of a class of boatmen employed on the river, some 400 in
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_727' name='Page_727' href='#Page_727'>727</a></span>
number, in whom we have an example of physical labor and exposure to the
elements scarcely equalled in any country, endured by them with no perceptible
prejudice, but apparently with advantage to their health. These
men sleep on a narrow plank across their boats, with no other protection than
a single blanket; yet there is probably in the world no class of men of more
athletic forms, and notwithstanding their indifferent attention to the conditions
of health, more capable of hard service. So far as can be gathered
from Colonel Childs' observations, it seems that he would rely chiefly on foreign
labor for the construction of the proposed work.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
CLIMATIC TRIALS.
</p>

<p>
He seems to think it is not unlikely that foreigners, already accustomed
to hard labor, may, when thoroughly acclimated, and under no unnecessary
exposure, be capable of a fair amount of labor in this country, although not
as great an amount as in higher latitudes. He states that of the party engaged
in the survey west of the lake, nine were unaccustomed to the climate.
After a few months, a slight fever, followed by ague, prevented some of the
number from continued daily exercise; but being in all cases under the control
of medicine, it was of short duration. During seven months in this part
of the state, illness in the party at no time interrupted a daily prosecution
of the survey. Upon the San Juan River, the surveying party consisted of
twelve persons, exclusive of native citizens. The survey occupied six and a
half months, from March to September. 'The party generally enjoyed good
health, and no individual was prevented by indisposition, beyond a day or
two, from full service. Of those engaged as axemen in clearing the line, two
were northern men, whose daily exercise exceeded that usual to men in canal-work,
without detriment to health or constitution.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Soil.</i>—From San Juan Harbor to where the proposed canal would strike
the river, the soil is vegetable mould, coarse sand, and sandy loam. Along
the river it is of a more mixed character, clay and loam predominating in the
valleys, and a gravelly clay, with detached stones, on the hills. West of
the lake, the central portion of the summit is principally clay; the remainder,
together with the soil through the valley to Brito, has a very nearly uniform
and equal intermixture of clay, sand, and gravel. The surface soil is generally
fine, and contains enough of vegetable mould to render it capable of
great production.
</p>

<p>
<i>Food.</i>—Among the staple articles of food that would, during the construction
of the canal, be most required for consumption, may be named
maize, plantains, and beans. Of the former and latter two crops are annually
raised on the same ground, and the supply of plantains is constant. Besides
these are bananas, oranges, lemons, pineapples, cocoanuts, squashes, melons,
tomatoes, and other garden vegetables. Colonel Childs, while considering
these sources of supply in food, is nevertheless of opinion that salt meat and
flour would have to be brought in large quantities from abroad. Fresh beef,
pork, and poultry are abundant in the country.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Opinion of Colonel Abert and Lieutenant-colonel Turnbull.</span>—Although
a different impression has been sought to be produced in the public
mind, yet the government of the United States had no direct interest in the
proposed canal, nor manifested any other than might naturally attach to any
enterprise of supposed general importance. The surveys of Colonel Childs
seem, nevertheless, to have been sent to the secretary of war, with a request
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_728' name='Page_728' href='#Page_728'>728</a></span>
for the opinion of the government engineers. Mr Conrad politely referred
it to Colonel Abert and Lieutenant-colonel Turnbull, of the bureau of topographical
engineers, who give their opinion in a brief letter, dated March 20,
1852. Proceeding upon Colonel Childs' data, they think his plan practicable,
that his estimates for a canal of seventeen feet are liberal, and that
some reductions might possibly be made. They think that a shorter line
might be traced between the port of San Juan and the point of intersection
with the river, and recommend another survey of that portion.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Opinion of English Engineers.</span>—The American minister in England,
at the request of the company, appears to have transmitted Colonel Childs'
surveys to the earl of Malmesbury, with a wish that he would submit it to
competent English engineers for their opinion. James Walker, Esq., civil
engineer, and Edward Aldrich, captain of the royal engineers, were named
for this service. They seem not only to have examined Colonel Childs' survey,
but to have subjected that gentleman, who was then in England, to a
very close personal examination. Taking his plans, measurement, and statements
to be correct, their opinion is, on the whole, favorable. They think
that his estimates for work are ample, but regard the amount set down for
'contingencies' (fifteen per cent) too small by at least ten per cent, that is to
say, that it should have been twenty-five instead of fifteen per cent. Of all
the works of the proposed navigation, they regard the Brito or Pacific harbor
as least satisfactory. To use their own language: 'Presuming Colonel Childs'
statements and conclusions to be correct, the Brito harbor is in shape and size
unworthy of this great ship navigation, even supposing the Pacific, to which
it is quite open, to be a much quieter ocean than any we have seen or have
any information of.'
</p>

<p>
They also object to the proposed size, and suggest a canal twenty feet deep
instead of seventeen, sixty feet wide at the bottom instead of fifty, and the
locks 300 feet instead of 250, as being one 'more efficient for the general purposes
of trade, by steam or sailing vessels.' This would, of course, be attended
with great additional cost; but, as they truly observe, 'if the junction of the
Pacific with the Atlantic be worth doing at all, it is worth doing well.' They
conclude that, judging from the data, without presuming to vouch for their
accuracy, the work is practicable, 'and would not be attended with engineering
difficulties beyond what might naturally be expected in a work of this
magnitude;' that the surveys have every appearance of accuracy, and they
are satisfied of the perfect fairness and candor of Colonel Childs; that the
works are generally sufficient for the purpose they are intended to answer;
and 'that the estimates upon the present value of money are adequate, in a
general way, so far as judgments can be formed from the documents produced
and the explanations of Colonel Childs.'
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Opinion of British Capitalists.</span>—We come now to a point not indicated
in the report of Colonel Childs, viz., the refusal of the leading capitalists of
England to engage in the projected work.
</p>

<p>
It is well known that at least two expeditions or missions to England were
undertaken by agents of the canal company. At their first visit in 1851, they
were unable to present any specific data upon which to solicit the aid of capitalists;
they, however, made out a hypothetical case, which they submitted,
and received for answer, 'Substantiate your statements by facts, and no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_729' name='Page_729' href='#Page_729'>729</a></span>
difficulty will be experienced in securing the financial aid which you desire;
until then, we can return you no definite answer.' This reply was not made
public in terms, but the agents, on their return, proclaimed that the 'great
European capitalists had engaged to furnish half the capital for the enterprise.'
A few, and it is believed only a few, persons, considering the precise
source whence this vaunt came, attached the slightest importance to it.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
REASONS FOR DECLINING.
</p>

<p>
The second expedition was made in 1852, and this time the agents took out
with them both Colonel Childs and his surveys. The opinion of certain British
engineers (as we have seen) was procured, and the whole matter resubmitted
to the great capitalists, who now, for the first time, thought it
sufficiently advanced to merit their serious attention. The result of their
examination was communicated to the company in a letter from Mr Bates,
head of the house of Baring Brothers, in August 1852, and consisted in a
declension to embark in the enterprise, for a variety of reasons, chiefly, of
course, financial.
</p>

<p>
1. The dimensions of the canal were not such as, in their opinion, to meet
the requirements of commerce, and the work could not be used except by
medium-sized steamers and small vessels.
</p>

<p>
2. That the proposed dimensions were not in conformity with those required
by the charter of the company, and that it could not be built of the
proposed dimensions without securing a modification of the charter, which,
in the existing state of feeling in Nicaragua, it was not likely could be
effected.
</p>

<p>
3. That, supposing the work not to exceed the estimated cost of $31,000,000,
the returns, to meet the simple interest of the investment at six per
cent, must be at least $1,860,000 over and above its current expenses; or, to
meet this interest, and the percentage to be paid to Nicaragua, it must
reach, over and above its expenses, $2,269,200. Estimating the expenses of
repairs, superintendence, cost of transportation, etc., at $400,000 a year (a
sum regarded as too small), then the gross returns to make the work pay
must be $2,670,000.
</p>

<p>
4. But it is found, by inquiry and calculation, that little, if any, of the
European trade with the Orient would pass through the canal, inasmuch as
the passage by the way of Cape Good Hope is, on an average, 1,500 miles
nearer than by way of the proposed work.
</p>

<p>
5. That even if the distance were in favor of the proposed canal, its small
size would prevent nearly, if not quite, two thirds of the vessels engaged in
the Indian trade from passing it; and this objection would equally lie against
most of the vessels employed in the trade with western America, the only
trade in which the canal would prove serviceable to Europe.
</p>

<p>
6. That the heavy toll of $3 a ton on ships would prevent such vessels as
could pass the canal from doing so, inasmuch as on a vessel of 1,000 tons the
toll would be $3,000, or more than the average earnings of such vessels on
their voyages.
</p>

<p>
7. That a canal of the proposed size could only be used by small passenger-steamers,
the returns from which would not be adequate to pay the current
expenses of the enterprise.
</p>

<p>
While unhesitatingly conceding the immense local advantages of a canal
to the United States, these capitalists confessed themselves utterly unable to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_730' name='Page_730' href='#Page_730'>730</a></span>
discover how it could prove of compensating value to the men who should
invest their money in the enterprise. They therefore, for these and other
reasons, declined to meet the views of the projectors and their agents.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">Guarantee of the United States, etc.</span>—By the convention of 1850 between
the United States and Great Britain, a qualified guaranty was extended
to this enterprise, in common with several others. There was also a clause
inserted with direct reference to this company, which provided that it should
'have a priority of claim over every other company to the protection of the
United States and Great Britain,' on condition that it should, within 'one
year from the date of the ratification' of the convention, 'conclude its arrangements
and present evidence of sufficient capital subscribed to accomplish
the undertaking.' The treaty was ratified, and the ratifications exchanged
July 5, 1850. No subscription of stock having taken place, and no evidence
of capital having been presented in the time specified, or indeed at any other
time, the company forfeited this special protection in July 1851; and as the
twelve years within which the work was to be constructed will expire in
1861, it may be assumed that its prosecution will depend upon new conditions
and combinations. Indeed, it may be questioned if the opening of railways
between the oceans may not indefinitely postpone the project of a canal;
for, however desirable such a work may be, its realization will depend upon
precisely those practical considerations which apply to the simplest works of
public utility. It will not do to foot up the commerce between Europe and
Asia, and assume, as has generally been the case, that the totals will pass
through the canal, if constructed. Now, the simple truth is, that, so far as
Europe is concerned, that part of her trade which goes to ports on the Pacific
coast of America, to the Sandwich Islands, Japan, the northern ports of
China, to New Zealand and Australia, is all that will be materially benefited
by the construction of a canal. As regards Australia, the principal advantage
would be in having a safer, easier, and consequently quicker and surer
means of communication than is afforded by the Cape of Good Hope; for the
Pacific Ocean is preëminently the sea of steamers, and where steam navigation,
in respect of speed at least, is destined to achieve its most brilliant success.
So far as the United States is concerned, the advantages of such a work
would naturally be greater than to Europe.

<p>
But it is not to be assumed that all the trade, much less all the travel,
treasure, and mails to the points which I have indicated, will, under any circumstances,
pass through a canal. The passengers between New York and
San Francisco, amounting annually to nearly 100,000, would never consent
to make a voyage of from 1,000 to 2,000 miles out of their way, to Nicaragua,
Panamá, Darien, or Atrato, for the sake of passing through a canal, however
grand, when by a simple transshipment at Honduras, for instance, and a transit
of 209 miles by railway, they would be able to avoid this long detour, and effect
a saving of from 5 to 8 days of time; for even if steamers were to run to
any canal which might be opened, and supposing no detention on account of
locks or other causes (calculated by Colonel Childs at 2 days), even then it
would be necessary for them to stop, for coals and other supplies, more than
quadruple the time that would be occupied by the passengers over the railway
in effecting their reëmbarkation. And what is true of passengers is
equally true of treasure, the mails, and light freight of small bulk and large
value.
</p>

<p>
I do not wish to be understood as arguing against a canal; what I mean
to illustrate is this: that, open a canal wherever we may, it will always stand
in the same relation to a railway as does the baggage-train to the express.
A canal would be chiefly, if not wholly, used by ships and vessels carrying
heavy and bulky freights; but as most articles of this kind are kept in stock
in all the principal ports of the world, it is not of so much consequence to
have rapidity as constancy of supply, and hence, unless the canal shall be
constructed so economically as to admit of a moderate tonnage rate, it is not
improbable that ships of this kind would find it more economical to follow
the routes now open. <i>Squier's States of Cent. America.</i>

In tracing, or attempting to trace, the routes of recent travellers in Darien,
there is extraordinary difficulty, although the locality in question does not
exceed a space of 40 miles by 30. Strange to say, the routes of the old

Milla de Santa Ella,<a name='FA_XXXIV-54' id='FA_XXXIV-54' href='#FN_XXXIV-54' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-54]</a> can be followed on the old Spanish maps, but not in our
modern ones, even the best; while there are no data hitherto published that
afford more than a guess at the tracks of modern explorers after leaving the
sea-coast. Mr Gisborne has compiled, or rather copied, the principal part of
the map, on which he has shown, <i>in red</i>, those portions which he himself saw
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_732' name='Page_732' href='#Page_732'>732</a></span>
and was enabled to lay down. No surveyor who reads his <i>Journal</i> and <i>Report</i>
can doubt that he has given eye-sketches, aided by compass bearings
and estimated distances; but the estimation of a practised eye is not to be
undervalued. Dr Cullen can be traced up the Tuyra to Yavisa, and up the
Paya; also up the Savana, but no farther inland.
</p>

<p>
The state of our geographical knowledge of that exceedingly interesting
region is the following:
</p>

<p>
All examinations, all surveys, of the Great Isthmus were made by Spain
alone, while she held the country (till the years 1821-31). Very good maps
of much of the Spanish territory existed at that time; but they have been
copied and recopied by all manner of hands; scales and bearings have been
altered, not intentionally, but by mistake; names omitted or misspelled;
and absolute longitudes applied erroneously. Thus good original work came
to be so deteriorated by its transmutations as to be almost useless.
</p>

<p>
No surveys need be better than some of the Spanish works undertaken
toward the end of the last and during the beginning of this century.
Methods and instruments were used by Tofiño, Malaspina, Espinosa, Bauza,
Córdova, and others, that were not adopted, if known, by French or English
surveyors until afterward. Triangulation without the compass, bases obtained
by angular measurements of known objects,<a name='FA_XXXIV-55' id='FA_XXXIV-55' href='#FN_XXXIV-55' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-55]</a> and the most perfect
style of plan-drawing on true principles, were practised by Spaniards before
this century commenced.
</p>

<p>
The south coast of the Great Isthmus and the interior of Darien were not
explored and mapped sufficiently, because of the hostile Indians, and political
reasons connected with the gold mines in that district. There was also
another source of error in that particular vicinity which has only recently
been eliminated; namely, the great difference of longitudes, according to the
maps, between places on opposite sides of the Isthmus which are really in
the same meridian. This amounted to more than 30 miles along all the coast
from Chiriquí to Darien with respect to the corresponding southern coast-line.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the far-seeing and indefatigable hydrographer to the admiralty,
Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, the British surveys have included much of the
coasts of Central America, and they are now placed in relatively correct
positions on our latest maps. Having therefore exact coast-lines, or boundaries,
we can avail ourselves more readily of much Spanish interior detail;
but it is exceedingly difficult to get at the <i>original</i> works.
</p>

<p>
A very neatly engraved and <i>apparently</i> complete map of the Isthmus has
been lately published at New Orleans by Dr Autenreith, but in reality it is
only a copy of Spanish documents and recent surveys made by England; it
is not an original work. There are in this country at present more materials
for a map of Darien than exist elsewhere. Bauza brought copies of all the
Spanish-American documents to this country, with many original maps; but
there is still a great extent, nearly all the interior of the Isthmus of Darien,
unexamined by the eye of a surveyor.
</p>

<p>
In the last century (1780), a Spanish party of five engineers and surveyors,
under Donoso, escorted by a large body of troops,<a name='FA_XXXIV-56' id='FA_XXXIV-56' href='#FN_XXXIV-56' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-56]</a> was stopped by the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_733' name='Page_733' href='#Page_733'>733</a></span>
Indians in the Chucunaque River, and obliged to return without executing
their orders to survey the region near Caledonian harbor; and <i>this</i> was the
<i>last</i> attempt by Spain, or by <i>any one</i>, to make a regular survey of the interior
of that part of the Isthmus.
</p>

<p>
In the valuable collection of Mr Arrowsmith are many Spanish documents,
among which one plan, dated 1774, shows all the Spanish establishments,
military and religious, as well as mining, at that date, in Darien. Others
show details of a previous century, and a few give the earliest settlements of
the 16th century.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
INJURY TO TRUTHFUL GEOGRAPHY.
</p>

<p>
And here allow one word to be said of the injury to <i>truthful</i> geography,
caused by copying all materials without acknowledgment, or by adding
imaginary topography without explanation. The map by Dr Autenreith has
much the appearance of an exact survey; there is no distinction made between
those parts for which there is authority and those which are partly the results
of imagination (the interior hill-work).
</p>

<p>
The public in general being unaware of the <i>authorities</i> for a map, the mere
copyist is often supposed to be the <i>author</i> of the work. Maps or charts that
are not original ought always to show from what data they have been compiled.
</p>

<p>
In order to assist in now forming a correct opinion of Darien, a retrospective
historical glance at a few points is necessary.
</p>

<p>
The first settlement in all America was founded in 1509 at the mouth of
the Atrato. It was called Santa Maria de la Antigua. The next settlement on
the Isthmus was at Acla, or Agla, in 1514, a few miles inland<a name='FA_XXXIV-57' id='FA_XXXIV-57' href='#FN_XXXIV-57' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-57]</a> from that port
or bay now famed in history and romance, called by Paterson Caledonian
Harbor. It was from Agla that Balboa crossed to the South Sea, and that
the earliest expeditions to Peru were despatched.
</p>

<p>
In 1532 these two settlements were abandoned, and their population transferred
to Nombre de Dios and Panamá. This is said to have been done on
account of the unhealthy site of Santa Maria de la Antigua, surrounded by
marshes and mangrove jungles; but why Agla was abandoned does not appear,
except by Paterson's narrative, whence it may be inferred that the settlers
there were harassed by the Indians, and were too far from the sea-shore.
Besides which, as intercourse increased with places on the Pacific coasts it
became, no doubt, more convenient to have a principal rendezvous on the
southern shore more accessible from the Pacific.
</p>

<p>
In those early days so famed was Darien for gold, that the province was
called 'Golden Castile'<a name='FA_XXXIV-58' id='FA_XXXIV-58' href='#FN_XXXIV-58' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-58]</a> (Castilla del Oro). It was the principal portion of
that 'tierra firme,' so famed afterward as the 'Spanish Main,' the real
'El Dorado' to which Sir Walter Raleigh went in 1517-18, Sir Francis Drake
in 1557, troops of buccaneers in the 17th century, and the Scotch colony
in 1698.
</p>

<p>
Repeated aggressions on this auriferous district, where abundance of gold
was procured by black slave labor, after the aborigines had been diminished
in numbers by oppressive cruelties, induced Spain to close and abandon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_734' name='Page_734' href='#Page_734'>734</a></span>
mines for a time (early in the 18th century)—even those famous ones in the
mountains of Espíritu Santo near Cana, from which alone more gold went
through Panamá in a year than from all the other mines of America taken together.
These Cana mines were sacked in 1702 and 1712 by English, in 1724
by French, and by the Indians in 1727. Nevertheless, in 1774 the mining
operations were again going on, having been reëstablished a few years previously.
</p>

<p>
When Cana was taken by the expedition (as narrated by Davis) sent from
Jamaica by Colonel Beckford in 1702, there were about '900 houses' (probably
most of them mere huts); therefore, the population could hardly have been
less than 3,000 at that time. From 1719 to 1727 there was a great and general
resistance of the Indians, who attacked the Spaniards in all directions, and
drove them out of all the detached settlements. Some years afterward peace
was made (in 1740), missions of the Jesuits advanced among the natives, and by
their aid not only much topographical knowledge was acquired, but Spanish settlements
in the interior were renewed and mines worked. But the Indians
again rebelled; therefore, small forts were reëstablished at Yavisa, Molineca,
and Santa Maria Real, with a new post (in 1780) at <i>El Príncipe</i>, or Ocubti,
from which a road was cut by Arisa, leading toward Caledonian Harbor.
The fort El Príncipe does not appear in the Spanish MS. map of 1774; it
was built about 1785, when the Spaniards had again advanced into the interior
Indian territory.
</p>

<p>
In 1788 Milla de Santa Ella, an officer of Spain, went from Caledonian
Harbor to El Príncipe direct by the road then recently opened by the Spaniards;
but as he did not think it advisable to return the same way, he went
down the Savana, and up the Chucunaque to the Tubuganti and Chueti
rivers, whence he crossed to his station at Caledonian Harbor by the same
route, undoubtedly, that Paterson traversed on his visit to the Indian great
chief at Ponca in 1698.
</p>

<p>
The examination of no traveller, except Humboldt, previous to 1850,
induced a belief that a canal might be cut directly through Darien. Dr
Cullen's personal inspection of Caledonian Harbor, and of the Savana River,
with their neighborhood, added to the information he obtained orally and
by reading, led him to the conclusion that the lowest summit level between
those places did not exceed 300 or 400 feet, while it might be very much less.
Feeling so confident that a lower level existed, he went there again to explore;
but while collecting further information and arranging preliminaries, at
Bogotá, the seat of government in New Granada, Mr Gisborne (an engineer
employed by Messrs Fox and Henderson) made short excursions from each
side of the Isthmus, which satisfied him that the lowest summit level does
not exceed 160 feet above the sea.
</p>

<p>
According to the most authentic map of this district, Mr Arrowsmith's
last printed, not yet published, the distance across in a direct line—between
deep water on each side—is about 33 miles. The windings of a canal may
require nearly a third more, and if so, the whole distance to be canalized is
about 40 miles—<i>a shorter distance than can be found elsewhere</i>.
</p>

<p>
Mr Gisborne's examination of the principal features of this line across
Darien, however incomplete, is a material advance toward certainty. We
have his two bases of operations, at Caledonian Harbor and San Miguel
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_735' name='Page_735' href='#Page_735'>735</a></span>
(entrance), nearly determined by recent government surveys, and we have
his character as a guaranty for the value of those details which he has given
in his <i>Report</i>. There may be a few miles of distance to settle, and there
may be doubts whether the river near his watershed, or summit level, called
by him <i>Caledonia</i>, may not be another river, perhaps the Chucunaque, or
one of its tributaries; and moreover, that the range of heights supposed by
him to separate those rivers is not truly placed, while his river Caledonia
(otherwise the Golden River, or Aglatomate) winds through a more northerly
area. But these are trifles compared with his barometric measurement of
the summit level, and his own overlapping eye-views of the country which
he did not traverse.
</p>

<p>
If indeed the mouth of the Savana be not accurately laid down, or assumed
by him, if it be much farther west than he supposed, his surveys may not
have overlapped; and he may have looked across two different plains; in
which case there may be yet another ridge or watershed beneath the rivers
which he actually touched. The expedition employed by our government to
survey this coast did not examine the mouths of rivers running into San
Miguel. Only the western part of that gulf was examined in continuing the
coast line. Hence the position of the Savana may be less accurately known
than is generally supposed.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
A HASTY SCRAMBLE.
</p>

<p>
It is hardly necessary to remark here that to make independent observations
for latitude, longitude, distance, and accurate triangulation requires
more time and instruments than can be carried in a hasty scramble through
a wild country.
</p>

<p>
Mr Gisborne's examination of the geology and mineralogy is valuable.
Far from discovering any remarkable impediments to cutting a canal, he
states that there are <i>no</i> particular engineering difficulties with respect to the
<i>ground</i>; that there is much stratified shale-rock, easy to quarry, and fit to
line a canal. There is abundance of fine timber. Mangrove forests, rather
than jungles, surround the waters of the gulf. Densely matted underwood
follows on drier ground; and then, on the elevated country, there are magnificent
timber-trees very little encumbered by underwood.
</p>

<p>
Having thus endeavored to take a general view of this question, we may
perhaps ask ourselves what are the greatest impediments to the excavation
of a canal—impediments exceeding those that would attend any corresponding
work in Europe.
</p>

<p>
Supposing that political arrangements are satisfactorily completed, the
claims of other parties compromised or barred, and adequate funds disposable,
the only peculiar and important impediments will be two—the natives and
the climate. The native or Indian question, as connected with the independence
and rights of the aborigines, should be considered deliberately.
That the Indians may be overawed and conciliated by proper management,
there is no doubt; but their reasonable claims must be satisfied, irrespective
of all jurisdiction assumed over them by New Granada—a jurisdiction which
the natives of Darien repudiate. Fair dealing, while an overpowering force
is in sight, will prevent any attempt to have recourse to arms, or to molest
the parties employed about a canal, and would therefore obviate any irritating
and probably prolonged guerrilla hostilities.
</p>

<p>
It is estimated that there are about 5,000 independent Indians on the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_736' name='Page_736' href='#Page_736'>736</a></span>
Isthmus east of Costa Rica. Of these, it may be presumed that there are not
2,000 capable of bearing arms; a small number when dispersed in the highlands
between Costa Rica and Chocó, but quite enough to molest small parties
of workmen very seriously.
</p>

<p>
For defensive purposes, as well as for the general order and discipline of
very large bodies of laborers, in a wild country, some degree of military
organization and an acquiescence in military discipline would seem to be
indispensable.
</p>

<p>
Whether convicts might be employed advantageously may be a subject
for grave consideration. In clearing the wood of a tropical forest, and exposing
ground to the sun's rays for the first time, much pestilential sickness may
be caused, as has been repeatedly proved (at Pulo Penang, Fernando Po, and
many other places). It cannot be doubted that convicts would be peculiarly
liable to the influence of such diseases, and therefore it might be unwise to
make such an experiment. Natives of tropical climates, or Chinese, would
probably be able to stand the malaria of newly cleared ground far better than
Europeans.
</p>

<p>
The most formidable, because permanent and irremediable, obstacle is
unquestionably the climate. There is no doubt that rain prevails about two
thirds of the year, even on the higher grounds of Darien; while it is no less
certain that in the gulf of San Miguel (where mangrove jungles bound low,
muddy shores, and the great fall of tide exposes extensive mud-banks) there
is a continued succession of rains, more or less heavy, except during short
intervals. Examine any travellers' accounts, read their narratives—they
themselves bear witness to the undeniable fact, although in <i>general</i> terms
they may say there is not <i>so much</i> rain, and it is not <i>so</i> unhealthy, as has been
supposed.
</p>

<p>
Many Europeans state they did not suffer, although much and continuously
exposed to the rains and heat. Active and temperate men have not
found the climate very detrimental. Persons who have had many years' experience
there assert that care and regularity will ward off such attacks of
fever or dysentery as are common among thoughtless Europeans unaccustomed
to tropical regions.
</p>

<p>
It is possible that the great rise of tide on the south side of the Isthmus
may tend to purify the air on its shores, and this effect, in such a place as
San Miguel Gulf, may be very beneficial.
</p>

<p>
On the Atrato, at Chagres, at Portobello, and other notoriously unhealthy
places, there is little or no rise of tide; and the air among the mangrove
jungles becomes at times pestilential. Seemann, in his <i>Voyage of the Herald</i>,
recently published, gives so correct a description of such places that it deserves
attention. He says (vol. i. p. 249): 'The sea-coast, and those parts
influenced by the tides and the immediate evaporation of the sea, produce a
quite peculiar vegetation, which is generally characterized by a leathery,
glossy foliage, and leaves with entire margins. In all muddy places, down
to the verge of the ocean, are impenetrable thickets formed of mangroves,
which exhale putrid miasmata, and spread sickness over the adjacent districts.
Occasionally, extensive tracts are covered with the "<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Guagara de
puerco</span>," its fronds being as much as 10 feet high. Myriads of mosquitoes
and sand-flies fill the air. Huge alligators sun themselves on the slimy banks,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_737' name='Page_737' href='#Page_737'>737</a></span>
lying motionless, blinking with their great eyes, and jumping into the water
directly any one approaches. To destroy these dreaded swamps is almost
impossible.'
</p>

<p>
Again (pp. 251, 252), he says: 'Forests cover at least two thirds of the
whole territory. The high trees, the dense foliage, and the numerous climbing
plants, almost shut out the rays of the sun, causing a gloom which is the
more insupportable as all other objects are hidden from view. Rain is so
frequent, and the moisture so great, that the burning of these forests is impossible.'
'From reading the highly colored accounts with which many
travellers have endeavored to embellish their narratives, the European has
drawn, in imagination, a picture of equinoctial countries which a comparison
with nature at once demolishes.'
</p>

<p>
Speaking of the 'vegetable ivory,' and referring to the climate, Mr. Seemann
says (p. 222): 'It grows in low, damp localities, and is diffused over the
southern parts of Darien and the vicinity of Portobello, districts which are
almost throughout the year deluged by torrents of rain, or enveloped in the
thick vapor that constantly arises from the humidity of the soil and the
rankness of the vegetation.'
</p>

<p>
Describing the appearance of one of these mangrove forests, as they may
be called, the same author observes (p. 73): 'The trees were actually in the
water. The tall mangroves, with roots exposed for 12 or 14 feet, formed a
huge tangled trellis-work, from which the tall stems rose to a height of 60 or
70 feet.' <i>Fitzroy's Further Considerations on the Great Isthmus of Cent. Am.</i>

</p>

<p class="sidenote">THE LONG-SOUGHT WAY.</p>

<p class="p2">
The project of uniting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by a canal large
enough to permit the passage of sea vessels has attracted the attention and
enlisted the earnest sympathies and efforts of the Old and New World, from
the discovery of the Isthmus of Panamá down to the present time. The
great historian Prescott says: 'The discovery of a strait into the Indian
Ocean was the burden of every order from the government. The discovery
of an Indian passage is the true key to the maritime movements of the fifteenth
and the first half of the sixteenth centuries.' The desire to discover
this passage, which was confidently believed to exist, and thus give to Spain
the dominion of the seas, and pour into her treasury all the wealth of that
marvellous land of exaggeration, the Spice Islands, sent Columbus, Pizarro,
Cortés, Balboa, Gil Gonzalez, and the other Spanish mariners and adventurers,
upon their long, arduous, and eventful voyages, and resulted in the discovery,
conquest, and settlement of the American continent.
</p>

<p>
However long the voyage; however great the discovery; however boundless
and rich the new countries that were subjected to the Spanish crown;
however brilliant the prowess of a chivalrous soldiery—the emperor always
asked, 'Have you discovered the way to the Spice Islands?' If not, he was
unsatisfied, and the discovery and conquest were robbed of half their value.
He was constantly reminding his brave and adventurous mariners that he
desired above all things to discover the way to the Spice Islands, and promised
great honors and rewards to the fortunate adventurer who should make
the discovery. In 1523 the Emperor Charles the Fifth wrote to Cortés, earnestly
urging him to search for a shorter way to the 'Indian Land of Spice,'
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_738' name='Page_738' href='#Page_738'>738</a></span>
and for a shorter and more direct passage between the eastern and western
coasts of Central America. In answer to the emperor, Cortés wrote: 'It
would render the king of Spain master of so many kingdoms that he might
consider himself lord of the world.' In 1524, in obedience to the emperor's
wishes, he fitted out an expedition to discover it. Columbus wrote to the
emperor: 'Your Majesty may be assured that as I know how much you have
at heart the discovery of the great secret of a strait, I shall postpone all interests
and projects of my own for the fulfilment of this great object.' It
was for the purpose of making this discovery that Gil Gonzalez fitted out the
expedition that resulted in the discovery of Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
The interest in the interoceanic communication was not confined to the
Spanish emperor, or his adventurous mariners. It extended to the learned
men of Spain, and seriously engaged their attention. Francisco Lopez de
Gomara, one of the earliest writers on America, in his chapter on 'the possibility
of a shorter passage to the Moluccas,' in his work on the <i>Two Indies</i>,
published in 1551, says: 'The passage would have to be opened across the
mainland from one sea to the other, by whichever might prove the most
profitable of these four lines; viz., either by the river Lagartos (Chagres),
which, rising in Chagres, at a distance of four leagues from Panamá, over
which space of territory they proceed in carts, flows to the sea-coast of Nombre
de Dios; or by the channel through which the lake of Nicaragua empties
into the sea; up and down which (the Rio San Juan) large vessels sail; and
the lake is distant only three or four leagues from the sea; by either of these
two rivers the passage is already traced and half made. There is likewise
another river which flows from Vera Cruz to Tecoantepec, along which the
inhabitants of New Spain (Mexico) tow and drag barks from one sea to the
other. The distance from Nombre de Dios to Panamá is seventeen leagues,
and from the gulf of Urabá to the gulf of San Miguel twenty-five, which are
the two most difficult lines.' Cortés was in favor of the first of these routes,
Gil Gonzalez of the second, and Pizarro of the third. Herrera, royal historiographer
of Spain, writing of the events of 1527, refers to the routes via
Nicaragua and Panamá, and the possibility of other connections between the
two oceans. Martin Behaim, a geographer of Nuremberg, Germany, was
probably the first who suggested the possibility of a natural communication
between the Atlantic and Pacific. So Magellan stated in his memorial of
November 28, 1520, to the court of Valladolid, asking permission to search
for such a channel. It was granted, an expedition was fitted out, and he
discovered the Straits of Magellan, bearing his name.
</p>

<p>
Soon after the discovery of Nicaragua by Gil Gonzalez, it was declared
and believed by many that there existed a navigable channel, connecting
Lake Nicaragua with the Pacific, and that vessels would be enabled to pass
from one ocean to the other. But no systematic attempt was made to ascertain
the truth of this conjecture until 1529, when Pedrarias de Ávila, then
governor of Nicaragua, sent an expedition of soldiers and Indians, under
Martin Este, to explore lakes Nicaragua and Managua; when they had penetrated
into a province called Voto, a little north of Lake Managua, they were
attacked by a large body of Indians, and compelled to return. They reported
that they saw from a mountain top a large body of water (doubtless the gulf
of Fonseca), which they supposed to be another lake. Don Diego Machuca
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_739' name='Page_739' href='#Page_739'>739</a></span>
soon afterward fitted out another expedition in the same year, which he
accompanied and commanded. It resulted in the discovery of the river San
Juan as the true outlet of the lakes. He sailed down that river to the
Atlantic. Machuca Rapids take their name from him.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
OVIEDO'S ACCOUNT.
</p>

<p>
Oviedo says that in 1540, at St Domingo, he met Pedro Cora, a pilot who
had been attached to the expedition of Martin Este, and subsequently to that
of Captain Diego Machuca. He gives a long and interesting account of the
second expedition, as narrated to him by Cora. Cora said that at the port of
Nombre de Dios he met with some old friends who had built a felucca and
brigantine on the shores of Lake Nicaragua at an expense of several thousand
dollars. Among them was Diego Machuca, who had been commandant of the
country of the Tenderí, and of the district about Lake Masaya. They embarked
on these vessels on Lake Nicaragua for the purpose of exploring it.
Captain Machuca, with two hundred men, advanced along the shore, keeping
in sight of the boats, which were accompanied by several canoes. After some
days they entered the San Juan River, and passed down to where its waters
appeared to flow into the sea. Being ignorant of their locality, they followed
the sea-coast in an easterly direction, and finally arrived at Nombre de Dios,
where the pilot Cora met them. They were arrested at this place by Doctor
Robles, who desired to found a colony at the mouth of the San Juan River,
and thus reap the benefit of their labor and discoveries, 'as is the custom,'
says Oviedo, 'with these men of letters; for the use they do make of their
wisdom is rather to rob than to render justice.' For this outrage he was
deprived of his office. The pilot, though strongly importuned, refused to tell
Oviedo where the river emptied into the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Oviedo says: 'I do not regard the lakes as separate, because they connect,
the one with the other. They are separated from the South Sea by a very
narrow strip of land.... This lake (Nicaragua) is filled with excellent fish.
But what proves that they are both one lake is the fact that they equally
abound in sea fish and turtles. Another proof is, that in 1529 there was
found in the province of Nicaragua, on the banks of this lake, a fish never
seen except in the sea, and called the sword-fish. I have seen some of these
fish of so great size that two oxen attached to a cart could hardly draw them....
The one found on the shores of this lake was small, being only about twelve
feet in length.... The water of the lake is very good and healthful, and a large
number of small rivers and brooks empty into it. In some places the great
lake is fifteen or twenty fathoms deep, and in other places it is scarce a foot
in depth; so that it is not navigable in all parts, but only in the middle, and
with barks specially constructed for that purpose.... It has a large number of
islands of some extent, covered with flocks and precious woods. The largest
is eight leagues in circumference, and is inhabited by Indians. It is very
fertile, filled with deer and rabbits, and named Ometepec, which signifies
<i>two mountains</i>. It formerly contained a population much more numerous than
now, divided into eight or ten villages. The mountain in this island toward
the east (Madeira) is lowest; the other (Ometepec) is so high that its summit
is seldom seen. I passed a night at a farm belonging to a gentleman called
Diego Mora, situated on the mainland'—probably near the site of Virgin
Bay. 'The keeper told me that during the two years he had been in that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_740' name='Page_740' href='#Page_740'>740</a></span>
place he had seen the summit but once, because it was covered with clouds.'<a name='FA_XXXIV-59' id='FA_XXXIV-59' href='#FN_XXXIV-59' class='fnanchor'>[XXXIV-59]</a>
There are many evidences that the channel of the San Juan River was
once much deeper and freer from rapids and obstructions than it is at present.
At one time, sea vessels passed regularly up and down the river. It
would be impossible for them to do so now. The river is too shallow, and
the rapids are too many and difficult. In 1648 a Spanish brig from Carthagena
(de la Indias) arrived at Granada, and discharged her cargo, reloaded,
and started on her return. On her voyage back, the river was found unnavigable
at one point, and the vessel returned to Granada; the cargo was taken
out, and the ship laid up, and finally broken to pieces. Thomas Gage, an
English monk, who visited Nicaragua in 1665, says that vessels often arrived
at Granada, from South America, Spain, and Cuba, and reloaded and returned
to those countries by way of the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
In 1781 Manuel Galisteo, by order of the Spanish government, examined
the country, and carefully surveyed a route for a canal between Lake Nicaragua
and the Pacific. He estimated the level of the lake above the Pacific to
be one hundred and thirty-four feet. The route selected by him was from
the mouth of the Rio Lajas in the lake to San Juan del Sur. Early in the
present century, a survey was made by an engineer name Thompson, of which
we have no details, further than that he adopted the report made by Galisteo.
</p>

<p>
In 1837 Mr Baily was employed by the federal government of Central
America, and made a careful survey of a route for the canal. He spent much
time and a considerable sum of money in making the surveys, but was never
paid for his services. Dr Andreas Örsted, of Copenhagen, made a survey in
1848, and published a map of the country. He selected the bay of Bolaños,
thirteen and a half miles from Lake Nicaragua, as the Pacific terminus of the
canal. In 1851 Colonel Childs, an Englishman, made a thorough survey and
estimate of the whole work. He selected Brito as the Pacific terminus.
According to his estimates, the actual length of water navigation, including
the San Juan River and Lake Nicaragua, would be one hundred and ninety-four
and one half miles. He submitted his plan and surveys to the British
government, by which it was referred to James Walker and Edward Aldrich,
royal engineers, who reported unfavorably. The plan and reports were then
laid before a committee of English capitalists, with the purpose of raising the
necessary capital for the work. But after a careful investigation, the committee
declined to recommend the enterprise, believing it would be unprofitable,
and more for the benefit of the United States than of Great Britain.
This survey, and the action of the British government upon it, furnish strong
confirmation of the general opinion, as to the purpose of that government, in
seizing Greytown and the bay of Fonseca. A survey was made in 1850 by the
Central American Transit Company.
</p>

<p>
After the independence of the Central American states had been established,
Manuel Antonio de la Cerda, afterward governor of Nicaragua,
represented to the federal congress, in July 1823, the urgent necessity for
opening the canal without delay. But no action was then taken in the matter.
During the next year several propositions relative to the construction
of the canal were made to the federal government by parties in Europe.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_741' name='Page_741' href='#Page_741'>741</a></span>
Barclay &amp; Co., of London, made a proposition, on the 18th of September,
1824, to open a canal, between the Atlantic and Pacific, by way of the San
Juan River and Lake Nicaragua, at their own cost, if the government would
assist them in certain particulars. On the 2d of February, 1825, Charles
Bourke and Matthew Llanos addressed a communication to the government,
stating that in the preceding December they had sent an armed brig with a
party of engineers to Greytown, to survey the route, and praying that they
might be granted: 1. An exclusive proprietorship and control of the canal;
2. An exclusive right to navigate the lakes and dependent waters by steam;
3. Free permission to use all natural products of the country necessary for
the work; 4. Exemption from duty for the goods and materials introduced
by the company during the pendency of the work. They offered to pay the
government twenty per cent on the tolls received, and to surrender the work
at the end of a certain number of years.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
MR. CLAY'S ASSURANCE.
</p>

<p>
On the 8th of February, 1825, Don Antonio José Cañas, then minister from
the federal government to the United States, addressed a communication to
Henry Clay, then secretary of state, upon the subject of the canal, soliciting
the coöperation of our government in the work, upon the ground that 'its
noble example had been a model and protection to all the Americas,' and entitled
it to a preference over any other nation in the 'merits and advantages
of the proposed undertaking.' He proposed by means of a treaty to effectually
secure its advantages to the two nations. Mr Clay instructed Colonel John
Williams, U. S. chargé d'affaires in Central America, to assure that government
of the great interest taken by the United States in an undertaking 'so
highly calculated to diffuse a favorable influence on the affairs of mankind,'
and to carefully investigate the facilities afforded by the route, and transmit
the intelligence acquired to our government. Colonel Williams never made
any report of his action under these instructions.
</p>

<p>
During the year 1825, many other propositions for the construction of the
canal were received by the federal government from Europe. The attention
of the government was thus strongly attracted to the importance and value
of the proposed canal, both as affording a considerable revenue to the government,
and aiding in the settlement of the country, and development of its
resources. In June 1825, the federal congress passed a decree defining the
terms and conditions upon which the canal might be constructed. Another
decree, published at the same time, fixed the period of six months for receiving
proposals for the work. The time was much too short, and but few offers
were received. Among them was one from Mr Baily, the surveyor, as agent
for the English house of Barclay, Herring, Richardson, &amp; Co., which was conditional,
and one from Charles Beninske for Aaron H. Palmer, of New York,
which was accepted. The contractors, under the name of 'The Central
American and United States Atlantic and Pacific Canal Company,' agreed
to open a canal through Nicaragua, which should be navigable for large ships,
and to deposit two hundred thousand dollars in the city of Granada, within
six months, for the preliminary expenses of the work; to erect fortifications
for its protection; and to commence work within one year. The contractors
were to receive two thirds of the tolls from the canal until they had been reimbursed
for the full cost of the work, with ten per cent interest; afterwards
to have one half of the proceeds for seven years, with the right to introduce
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_742' name='Page_742' href='#Page_742'>742</a></span>
steam-vessels. The government agreed to place at their disposal all the documents
in its possession relating to the canal; to furnish laborers at certain
wages; and to permit the cutting and use of the timber in the country. If
the canal was not completed, all the work done was to be forfeited to the government.
This contract was dated June 14, 1826. The contractors had not
sufficient capital for the construction of the canal, and failing to obtain it in
New York, addressed a memorial to the United States congress, praying the
assistance of the government in their work, which they represented to be of
national importance. The memorial was referred to a committee, but never
reported on. The enterprise excited considerable attention in New York,
and the grant obtained from the federal government of Central America was
believed to be valuable. Mr Palmer executed a deed of trust to De Witt
Clinton, Stephen Van Renssalaer, C. D. Clinton, Phillip Hone, and Lynde
Catlin, constituting them directors of the company which was being organized
for the construction of the canal. Mr Palmer went to England in 1827,
and endeavored, but without success, to obtain the coöperation of English
capitalists. All his efforts were ineffectual, the necessary capital could not
be raised, and the enterprise was abandoned. Mr Clay, then secretary of
state, earnestly advocated the construction of the canal, believing it would
be of great advantage to this country.
</p>

<p>
In 1828 an association of capitalists in the Netherlands, under the patronage
of the king of Holland, undertook the construction of the canal. In 1829
the king sent General Verveer, as plenipotentiary to Guatemala, with special
instructions relative to the canal. In October of the same year, commissioners
were appointed by the federal government to confer with General
Verveer, and on the 24th of July, 1830, they agreed upon a plan, which was
to be laid before the federal congress for its approval. The conditions were
much the same as in the contract with Mr Palmer. The revolution in Belgium,
and the separation of Holland, terminated this enterprise. The federal
congress had been stimulated to greater anxiety for the construction of
the canal by these various proposals and contracts, and believing that there
was more likelihood of its being made by the Dutch company than any other,
in 1832 made ineffectual efforts to renew negotiations with Holland for reviving
that company, and enabling it to complete its contract.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, the efforts and representations of Mr Clay, De Witt Clinton,
and other distinguished men had awakened public interest in the people
and government of the United States in the proposed canal, and convinced
them that it was important that our government should, if possible, control
the work, and reap the benefits and advantages which it was believed would
result to our commerce from it. On the 3d of March, 1835, the United States
senate adopted a resolution, requesting the president to consider the expediency
of opening negotiations with the Central American states and New
Granada for protecting by treaty stipulations companies undertaking to open
a canal across the Isthmus, connecting the two oceans, and of securing its
free and equal navigation to all nations. By virtue of this resolution, President
Jackson appointed Charles Biddle, and directed him to go to San Juan
del Norte, and thence across the Isthmus to the Pacific, by the proposed
route; to proceed to Guatemala, the capital, and with the aid of Mr De Witt
Clinton, U. S. chargé d'affaires, obtain all public papers, and copies of the laws
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_743' name='Page_743' href='#Page_743'>743</a></span>
passed, and all papers and information relating to the canal. He was also to
go to Panamá, and ascertain all about that route. Mr Biddle did not go to
Nicaragua, and died soon after his return to the United States. His mission
was a failure.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
ACTION OF THE GOVERNMENT.
</p>

<p>
The government of Central America now determined to survey the route
for the canal, and thus demonstrate to the world its practicability. In 1837
President Morazan employed Mr John Baily to survey the route, which he
did, as already stated. In 1838 a convention between Nicaragua and Honduras
authorized Peter Bouchard to make an agreement in France for the
organization of a company to construct the canal. He did not succeed in accomplishing
anything. Don Jorge Viteri, bishop of San Salvador, was sent
as ambassador to Rome, and make like efforts, but without success. In the
same year, a company of Americans in New York and New Orleans sent Mr
George Holdship to Central America. He made a contract with Nicaragua,
which had seceded from the federal republic, for the construction of a canal,
the establishment of a bank, and the introduction of colonists. This scheme
was extensive, but amounted to nothing, as the enterprise was soon abandoned.
</p>

<p>
In 1838, Aaron Clark, Herman Leroy, William A. Duer, Matthew Carey,
and William Radcliff, citizens of New York and Philadelphia, addressed a
memorial to congress, representing the necessity for the opening of the interoceanic
canal. It was referred to a committee, of which Hon. Charles F.
Mercer was chairman, who, upon the 2d of March, 1839, reported upon it,
recommending the following resolution, which was adopted:
</p>

<p>
'<i>Resolved</i>, That the president of the United States be requested to consider
the expediency of opening or continuing negotiations with the governments
of other nations; and particularly with those the territorial jurisdiction of
which comprehends the Isthmus of Panamá, and to which the United States
have accredited ministers or agents, for the purpose of ascertaining or effecting
a communication between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, by the construction
of a ship-canal; and of securing forever, by suitable treaty
stipulations, the free and equal rights of navigating such canal to all nations,
on the payment of reasonable tolls.' The president and senate, acting under
this resolution, negotiated and made a treaty between the United States and
New Granada, by which our government guaranteed the neutrality of the
Isthmus, and New Granada conceded a free transit across it. The Panamá
Railroad Company was organized by virtue of this treaty; and, as we all
know, the existing railroad across the Isthmus was built by them; with what
labor, and cost in money and human life, it is foreign to our purpose to
inquire.
</p>

<p>
Between the years 1838 and 1844, Central America was distracted by civil
wars, and all action relative to the canal was suspended. In 1844, Don Francisco
Castellon, minister from the republic of Nicaragua to France, made a
contract with a Belgian company, acting under the patronage of the king of
Belgium, for the construction of the canal. But this contract was as unsuccessful
as its predecessors. In 1846, Mr Marcoleta, Nicaraguan chargé
d'affaires to Belgium, made a contract with Louis Napoleon (the present
French emperor), then a prisoner at Ham, for its construction. With his
characteristic vanity, he stipulated that it should be called 'Canal Napoleon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_744' name='Page_744' href='#Page_744'>744</a></span>
de Nicaragua.' Napoleon wrote and published a pamphlet in London, upon
the subject, and made a feeble attempt to awaken the attention of capitalists,
but without success. His pamphlet had only a limited circulation, but was
afterward republished by M. Belly. On the 16th of February, 1849, William
Wheelright made a proposition in behalf of an English company for
the construction of the canal, but it was not acted upon.
</p>

<p>
On the 14th of March, 1849, Mr D. T. Brown, in behalf of certain citizens
of New York, and General Muñoz, commissioner for Nicaragua, entered
into a contract for the construction of a canal, but it was neither ratified by
the executive of that republic nor by the company in New York, within the
stipulated time. The seizure of Greytown by the English, in 1848, and the
pretext of a Mosquito protectorate, were rightly regarded by the Nicaraguan
government and our own, as directed to obtaining command and permanent
control and dominion over the only possible route for an interoceanic canal.
</p>

<p>
On the 21st of June, 1849, Mr Hise, U. S. chargé d'affaires to Nicaragua,
concluded a convention with commissioners appointed by that republic, giving
the United States a perpetual right of way through that republic, of
erecting forts, and protecting the transit. This convention was not approved
by our own government, or by that of Nicaragua. On the 4th of March,
1850, General Taylor was inaugurated president of the United States, and
soon after sent Mr E. G. Squier to Central America to supersede Mr Hise, as
chargé d'affaires to Guatemala, with special commissions to the other states of
Central America, "with full power to treat with them separately on all matters
affecting their relations with this republic." Upon his arrival in Nicaragua,
Mr Squier found an agent of Cornelius Vanderbilt, and others of
New York, who was endeavoring to obtain a grant from that government for
the construction of a canal. The government was at first indisposed to
listen to his overtures, until assured by Mr Squier that the United States
government would guarantee any charter, not inconsistent with our public
policy, that might be granted by Nicaragua.
</p>

<p>
On the 27th of August, 1850, a contract was signed between the government
of Nicaragua and the agent of the New York company, and afterward
ratified on the 23d of September following, containing the following provisions,
viz.:
</p>

<p>
1. That the American Atlantic and Pacific Ship Canal Company may construct
a ship-canal, at its own expense, from San Juan to Realejo, or any
other point within the territory of Nicaragua, on the Pacific, and make use
of all lands, waters, or natural materials of the country for the enterprise.
</p>

<p>
2. The canal shall be large enough to admit vessels of all sizes.
</p>

<p>
3. The grant is for eighty-five years from the completion of the work; the
surveys to be commenced within twelve months; the work to be completed
within twelve years, unless interrupted by unforeseen events. If not completed
within the stipulated time, the charter will be forfeited, and all work
done shall revert to the state. At the end of eighty-five years the canal shall
revert to the state; the company, nevertheless, shall receive fifteen per cent
annually of the net profits for ten years thereafter, if the entire cost of the
canal does not exceed twenty million dollars; but if it does, then it shall
receive the same percentage for twenty years thereafter.
</p>

<p>
4. The company to pay the state ten thousand dollars per annum, during
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_745' name='Page_745' href='#Page_745'>745</a></span>
the progress of the work, and to give it two hundred thousand dollars of the
capital stock, and to pay twenty per cent of the net profits for twenty years,
and twenty-five per cent thereafter.
</p>

<p class="sidenote">
FURTHER CONTRACT PROVISIONS.
</p>

<p>
5. The company to have the exclusive right to navigate the interior waters
of Nicaragua by steam, and within twelve years to open any land or other
route, by means of transit or conveyance across the state, and pay ten per
cent of the net profits of such transit to the state, and transport on such
transit, and the canal, when finished, the officers and employés of the republic
free of charge.
</p>

<p>
6. The canal to be open to the vessels of all nations.
</p>

<p>
7. The contract and the rights and privileges conceded by it to be held
inalienably by the individuals composing the company.
</p>

<p>
8. All disputes shall be settled by commissioners appointed in a specified
manner.
</p>

<p>
9. All machinery and other articles introduced by the company into the
state, for its own use, to enter free of duty; and all persons in its employ to
enjoy all the privileges of citizenship, without being subject to taxation or
military service.
</p>

<p>
10. The state concedes to the company, for purposes of colonization, eight
sections of land, on the line of the canal, in the valley of the river San Juan,
each six miles square, and at least three miles apart, with the right of alienating
the same under certain reservations. All settlers on these lands to be
subject to the laws of the republic, being, however, for ten years exempt from
all taxes and from all public service so soon as each colony shall contain fifty
settlers.
</p>

<p>
On the same day Mr Squier negotiated a treaty with Nicaragua, which
provided that citizens, vessels, and merchandise of the United States
should be exempt from duty in the ports of Nicaragua; and that citizens of
the United States should have a right of way through the republic. The
government of the United States agreed to protect the company in the full
enjoyment of its rights from the inception to the termination of its grant.
The rights, privileges, and immunities granted to the government and citizens
of the United States shall not accrue to any other government, unless it first
enter into the same treaty stipulations with Nicaragua as the United States
has done. This treaty was ratified by the Nicaraguan legislative chambers
on the 23d of September following, but was not acted upon by the United
States senate, to which it was sent by President Taylor. This treaty was
opposed by the British minister at Washington, who energetically exerted
himself to secure its defeat.
</p>

<p>
The Clayton-Bulwer treaty between the United States and England
guaranteed the neutrality of the canal, and both governments agreed to protect
any company undertaking the work. The object of our government in
this convention was to put an end to the Mosquito protectorate.
</p>

<p>
In August 1850 the company sent a party of engineers from New York
to Nicaragua to survey a route from Lake Nicaragua to the Pacific, near the
line taken by Galisteo and Baily. Soon afterwards the steamer <i>Director</i> was
sent from New York to Lake Nicaragua, and smaller boats were sent to the
San Juan River. A new road was opened to the Pacific from Virgin Bay on
the lake to San Juan del Sur. A line of steamers was established from New
York to Greytown, and from San Juan del Sur to San Francisco.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_746' name='Page_746' href='#Page_746'>746</a></span>
</p>

<p>
The new contract made with United States citizens, and ratified and enforced
by treaty with our own government, was not consistent with the wishes
or policy of Great Britain, but the generosity of our government in throwing
open the proposed canal to all nations disarmed hostile criticism, and deprived
Europe of any pretext for opposition or protest. It quickened England into
new energy, in the assertion of her claims under the Mosquito protectorate.
On the 15th of August, 1850, the British consular representative in Central
America addressed a note to the Nicaraguan government, in which he stated
the boundary claimed by his government as follows: 'The undersigned, her
Britannic Majesty's chargé d'affaires in Central America, with this view, has
the honor to declare to the minister of foreign relations of the supreme government
of Nicaragua, that the general boundary line of the Mosquito territory
begins at the northern extremity of the boundary line between the
district of Tegucigalpa in Honduras, and the jurisdiction of New Segovia; and
after following the northern frontiers of New Segovia it runs along the south-eastern
limits of the district of Matagalpa and Chontales, and thence in an
easterly course, until it reaches the Machuca Rapids, to the river San Juan.'
If this boundary line had been allowed, as claimed, it would have placed the
only possible route for the proposed canal in the occupation and control of
Great Britain. <i>Daniel Cleveland's Across the Nicaragua Transit</i>, MS., 118-42.

that American descendants of Spaniards should have the preference for the
position of curate; and yet, during the last thirty years, the most lucrative
curacies were given to European Spaniards. Of the 170 viceroys that ruled
in America, four only were of American birth, and those were reared or educated
in Spain. Out of 602 captain-generals, governors, and presidents, only
14 were Americans. Of 982 bishops and archbishops, 703 were Europeans,
and 279 Creoles. Most of the latter were nominated in early times, when
Europeans were few, navigation difficult, and mitres afforded more work than
money. <i>Guerra</i>, <i>Rev. N. Esp.</i>, i. 278-85.

in the córtes the rights of the Americans, specially of the aborigines,

to Spain in 1814, he was denounced by the absolutists, Conde de
Torre Muzquiz and Marqués de Mata Florida, and confined in a fort in Spain.

bewails the seeming ingratitude of some of his country's writers in saying
that Nicaragua's independence had cost nothing. The history of that period,
1811-21, it is true, records no bloody fields, no brilliant feats of arms; but it
presents an array of victims to the cause, of men who sacrificed their lives,
liberty, and fortunes to secure their country's freedom; and these sacrifices,
Ayon claims, should be remembered, and the sufferers' memory held in reverence.
<i>Apuntes</i>, 18. Squier, in <i>Travels</i>, ii. 378, speaks of a suppressed

occasion to quote so often, bears the title <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Bosquejo Histórico de las Revoluciones
de Centro América desde 1811 hasta 1834</span></i>. Its author, Alejandro Marure,
who was a professor of history and geography in the university of Guatemala,
and otherwise a prominent citizen, issued in Guatemala his 1st volume, sm.
4to, 295 pp., with designs on the frontispiece, in 1837; containing events to
1826 only. The publication of the other two volumes, it is understood, he
was obliged to withhold by order of his government. Montúfar, <i>Reseña,
Hist. Cent. Am.</i>, i., preface pp. iii. and iv., tells us the circulation of the 2d
vol. was not allowed; '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">un solemne auto de fé devoró la edicion entera.</span>' One
copy escaped, however, from which another edition was printed in later years.
It scathes the so-called conservative party, more properly entitled to the
appellations of fanatical and servile, for the infamous acts of its men that for
many years misgoverned the country. Its contents have been fully used by
Montúfar. The 3d volume has not been published, and the author's heirs
long refused to allow any one to see the manuscript. This work furnishes
an interesting account of political affairs in Guatemala from the first attempt
at separation from the mother country in 1811 to its accomplishment in 1821,
from an American standpoint; the intrigues by which Central America was
yoked to Iturbide's Mexican empire, and subsequent events culminating in
the second and final enforcement of independence, followed by the organization
of the federal government; rupture between Guatemala and the general
government, and victory of the latter; church and military affairs; intrigues
of parties; authorities being freely quoted to sustain statements. The author
does not enter into much detail on military operations, but is quite full in his
description of party workings, which affords a clear understanding of their
antagonistic interests. Under the title of <i>Efemérides de los hechos notables ...
de Centro América</i>, the same writer gave to the press at Guatemala, in 1844,
a 12mo of 77 pp., furnishing a very brief synopsis of the chief events that
occurred from 1821 to 1842, with tabular lists; quite useful as a chronology.

had held in public estimation by needlessly petitioning for a pardon when he
had not been imprisoned, and could at any time have left the country without
risk. Lorenzo Montúfar, a statesman and writer, tells us, in rebuttal,
that these men were of good intelligence and position; that Barrundia's peril
was imminent all the time of his concealment, and as only Spanish vessels
visited the ports, it would have been risky to attempt escape upon one of
them. Moreover, it was impossible to foresee when independence would be
attained. Under the circumstances, Barrundia had to ask for pardon when
he could get it. <i>Costa R.</i>, <i>Gaceta</i>, Sept. 2, 1854. Villar, the prosecuting officer,

remained unheeded, so far as it ever became known. One more was that of
Juan Argüello of Granada, in Nicaragua, who charged the governor with unjust
treatment of him in 1814, and demanded his trial and punishment. This
case was before the córtes Oct. 20, 1820. But as the second constitutional
epoch was so short-lived, Argüello's demand for justice had no better result
than preceding ones. A memorial of the ayuntamiento of Guatemala, on the
political condition of the province, expressing fear that the harshness extended
to men for political opinions might lead to evil consequences, and
asking for the pardon of prisoners, was presented March 24, 1814, to the
córtes. It was referred to a committee, and that was all the action taken,
till the king in 1817 granted an amnesty. <i>Córtes</i>, <i>Act. ord.</i>, March 24, 1814,

whether Guatemala should cast off the old mother country or not. Several
other things worthy of notice happened then among them. Canon Castilla,
though a friend of the archbishop, his prelate, who had advocated anti-independence,
favored the separation. Many of the officials declared for secession,

a petition of the ayuntamiento of Comayagua, objecting to the limited
scope of the decree of May 24, 1812, which authorized the establishment of
only two diputaciones in the whole of Guatemala, and asked for one in Comayagua
with Omoa, Trujillo, and the partido of Tegucigalpa, and that of San

a territory of 140 leagues from N. to S., and as many from E. to W.
<i>Córtes</i>, <i>Diario</i>, 1813, xviii. 61. I have no evidence as to when Honduras

into the partidos of Comayagua and Tegucigalpa, and the nine sub-delegations
of Gracias á Dios, San Pedro Zula, Tencoa, Yoro, Olanchito, Olancho Viejo,
Tegucigalpa, Choluteca, and Trujillo, having within it the ports of Omoa,

among them. It claimed that the journals published in Guatemala expressed
the views of only a few deluded men, whose ranks were becoming thinner
every day. That same organ had given to the public certain letters from the
ayuntamiento of Comitan, in Chiapas, objecting to the 2d art. of the Guatemalan
acta of Sept. 15th, on the ground that the country had no resources to
sustain a separate government, which had been evident since the yearly allowance
of $12,000 ceased; superadded to which, they said, the safety of
Mexico might be imperilled should Spain at some future time recover possession
of Cent. Am., which the latter, if independent, could not prevent, and

nothing by the union, and that it had resources of its own to exist as an independent
nation. He added that the provinces viewed with dislike the course
of the aristocrats at the capital. It could not be otherwise. Where was the
advantage of a connection with the city of Mexico, which was almost inaccessible

Am. were mostly very enthusiastic for Iturbide, and at the same time anxious
to rid themselves of the liberal party, whose members he calls an unbridled

having so much credit abroad, and such large resources to aid them. <i>Porvenir

that Cent. Am. could not be held as a province dependent from a republic,
which was practicable as a dependence of an empire. Others have
supposed that he was prompted by personal ambition. Marure, <i>Bosq. Hist.
Cent. Am.</i>, 73, and <i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 19, claim that it was the unavoidable
result of the situation, which is not exactly true. With the force at his
command, he might have maintained supremacy for a considerable time at
least. Filisola himself said that his object had been to avert civil war. In
his address of July 24, 1823, to the junta of Guatemala, he assured that body
that his recognition of its sovereignty had been with the sanction of the supreme
executive government of Mexico, communicated to him on the 18th of

vindictiveness of the priests being that in the general levy of taxes for the
state the property of the convents had not been spared. 'And thus was the
movement started by the aristocrats, seconded by their allies, the priests.'
Ex-president Morazan, referring to that catastrophe, uses these words: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Puesto
en manos de un feroz populacho, instigado por las funestas ideas que le
inculcaron sus sacerdotes, pereció al pié de las imágenes de los santos, á la
vista de sus inicuos jueces, y en presencia de la eucaristía, que estos cubrieran.</span>'
<i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 4. Flores had been noted for his charity to the poor, specially
to the Indians, to whom he constantly gave medical aid, medicines, and
other necessaries. The state assembly, after being restored in 1829, decreed
honors to his memory, and ordered placed in its hall of sessions an inscription
in letters of gold, as follows: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Al inmortal Vice-jefe Ciudadano Cirilo Flores,
mártir de la Libertad, sacrificado en Quezaltenango, en las aras de la ley.</span>'
In May 1831 the name of Ciudad Flores was given in his honor to the head
town of the district of Peten. <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 17, 28.

from violent acts on the part of liberals in Quezaltenango, such as forcibly
taking horses in the night from private houses and the Franciscan convent.

disastrously for the federal forces their third invasion of Salvador territory.
The actions of Gualcho and San Antonio were the first in which the great
Central American soldier and statesman Francisco Morazan figured as a general.
Morazan will stand in history in many respects as the best, and in all as
the ablest, man that Central America had. He was born in Honduras in 1799,
his father being a French creole from the W. I., and his mother of Tegucigalpa,
in Honduras. His education was such as he could obtain in the country at
that time; but his quickness of apprehension and thirst for knowledge soon
placed him far above his countrymen. He was of an impetuous temperament,
and possessed at the same time great decision and perseverance. His
bearing was free and manly, and his manner frank and open. These qualities
could not fail to and did secure him the love and respect of his fellow-citizens,
giving him an immense influence over them. In 1824 he was already
occupying the position of secretary-general of Honduras, and later was senator,
and for a time acting jefe of that state; but his temperament soon made
him turn his attention to martial affairs. He ever after was noted as a republican
of very liberal views. <i>Squier's Travels</i>, ii. 400; <i>Dunlop's Cent. Am.</i>,
170-1; <i>Astaburuaga</i>, <i>Cent. Am.</i>, 17. The writer of <i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>,
92, says that Morazan had been at one time a clerk in a notary's office at
Comayagua, where he '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">habia dado á conocer disposiciones muy felices, pero
poco honrosas, para la imitacion de letras ó firmas.</span>' It has been said that
Morazan joined the party opposed to the existing federal government at the
instigation of Pedro Molina. <i>Gaceta de S. Salv.</i>, Oct. 3, 1851. A portrait of
Morazan is given in <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 72.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-66'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-66'>[V-66]</a></span> It has been asserted that he offered his services to Salvador, and was
slighted, <i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 97-8, which finds confirmation in Arce's own
statement. <i>Mem.</i>, 88-9. Squier has it that Arce went to Mexico, <i>Travels</i>, ii.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-67'>[V-67]</a></span> A few days previously, on the 20th, the assembly of Guatemala decreed

one of the obstacles to the termination of the war. <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 22.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-70'>[V-70]</a></span> This took place on the 22d of Jan., 1829. The sedition, though soon

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-71'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-71'>[V-71]</a></span> The repulse was so unimportant, however, that Morazan does not even
mention it in his memoirs. <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 23; <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 61.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-72'>[V-72]</a></span> <i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 123; <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 23, gives the 18th as the
date. Morazan, <i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 14, says with reference to that defeat, '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Cerda
acreditó en esta derrota su ineptitud y cobardía y el enemigo su crueldad con
el asesinato de los vencidos.</span>' After that the town was given the title of Villa
de la Victoria; but later resumed its original name. This defeat was exaggerated
in San Salvador, where it was reported that Morazan was besieged in
La Antigua, and preparations to meet another invasion were hastily made.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-73'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-73'>[V-73]</a></span> Morazan might have been besieged in La Antigua; for during his stay
there he despatched a force to Quezaltenango, that should have been followed
by another from Guatemala, and destroyed between the latter and the few
forces that Irisarri might have brought against it in the hard roads of Istaguacan
and Laja; instead of which, Irisarri retreated toward Soconusco, to be
afterward undone and taken prisoner. Morazan's force occupied Los Altos,
took many prisoners, levied contributions which Irisarri had failed to get
from the Quezaltecs, and left the enemy powerless to recuperate. <i>Mem. Rev.
Cent. Am.</i>, 124; <i>Morazan's Memoirs</i>, quoted in <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 63.

Miguel Morazan. The Frenchman Raoul, now a general under Morazan,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-76'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-76'>[V-76]</a></span> The federal force that succumbed in Las Charcas was commanded by
their mayor-general, Agustin Prado, not Col Pacheco, as supposed by some.
The federals had no general now. Cáscaras had lost his reputation, and was
distrusted by the serviles. Arzú would not take the command, or was not
trusted on account of his ill success in the third invasion of Salvador. Morazan
had defeated Milla, Dominguez, Aycinena, Pacheco, and Prado. <i>Id.</i>,
63-4.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-77'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-77'>[V-77]</a></span> The representatives were, Arbeu for Vice-president Beltranena, Pavon
for Guatemala, Espinosa for Salvador, and Morazan for Honduras and Nicaragua.
The last propositions of Espinosa and Morazan were the following,
namely: 1st. That a provisional government should be formed in Guatemala,
composed of the chief of the state Mariano Aycinena, Mariano Prado, and
Morazan; 2d. That the two armies should be reduced to 1,000 men, Guatemalans
and Salvadorans in equal parts; 3d. That the provisional government
should be installed in Pinula, and afterward enter Guatemala with that force
to give it strength and preserve order in the state; 4th. A general forgetfulness
of the past. <i>Morazan</i>, <i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 5, 16; <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 65.
It is claimed, on the other hand, that Morazan really wanted the federal vice-president
and the chief of the state of Guatemala to throw up their offices,
the legislative assembly and representative council to cease exercising their
functions; and that of 1826, sitting at La Antigua, and which had made Zenteno
chief, was also to dissolve; the supreme court of justice was to stop acting.
Meantime, and until new elections took place, Morazan was to be clothed
with executive, representative, and judicial powers. Under the pretext of
restoring the sway of law and constitutional order, a dictatorship, emanating
from a war treaty, would have been created, whose sole object was to reward
the victor with an unlimited authority. The commissioners of the federal and
Guatemalan governments refused to accede, and presented counter-propositions
of a different nature, namely, to the effect that the existing high functionaries
should resign their powers, and a provisional government be established,
with one representative from each state, to govern till new elections and the
restoration of the constitutional régime. There were also propositions respecting
the government of the state of Guatemala. Full details in <i>Mem.
Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 125-9, 231-6, which are widely different from those in <i>Morazan</i>,
<i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 16. The government of Mexico, at the request of that of
Guatemala, tendered its mediation on the 20th of February, but it arrived
too late, and there was nothing left for it to do but to tender the hospitalities
of the Mexican soil to the victims of persecution. The full correspondence is
to be found in <i>Méx.</i>, <i>Mem. Rel.</i>, 1830, 2-3; also in <i>Suarez y Navarro</i>, <i>Hist. Méj.</i>,
407-14; this authority claims that Mexican mediation might have been finally
successful in restoring peace but for the opposition of the new chief of Guatemala.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-78'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-78'>[V-78]</a></span> A long account of the alleged outrages of Morazan's forces appears in
<i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 132-3. Marure, <i>Efem.</i>, 24, in referring to the capture
of Guatemala, makes no mention of any such abuses.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-79'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-79'>[V-79]</a></span> Morazan's answer was addressed to Gen. Aycinena, not recognizing the
latter as chief of Guatemala, Juan Barrundia's term not having expired when
Arce deposed him, in consequence of which act Aycinena rose to that position.
The dissolved authorities of 1826 were now assembled in La Antigua, and Morazan
held relations with them. Aycinena had changed his tone; he was no
longer the man of the manifestoes of 1827, of the proscriptive decrees, nor of
the stringent military orders of the first months of 1829. He did not now
call his opponents '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">un puñado de enemigos del órden, descamisados y forajidos.</span>'
<i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 72-5, 79-86.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-80'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-80'>[V-80]</a></span> Astaburuaga, <i>Cent. Am.</i>, 18, erroneously places the surrender on the
20th. The terms of the capitulation are given in <i>Arce</i>, <i>Mem.</i>, 98-4; <i>Montúfar</i>,
<i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 76-7. Only the life and property of the inhabitants were
guaranteed; the vanquished were in all else subject to the good-will of the
victor. José Milla y Vidaurre, in his biographical sketch of Manuel Francisco
Pavon, who figured in these events, claims that the capitulation was contrary
to Aycinena's wishes, who was ready to defend the place foot by foot.
Montúfar, quoted above, denies the statement, adding that it was advanced
solely to make the chief of the serviles and head man of the nobles appear as
a hero, and refers to the correspondence, which will show Aycinena quite
anxious to accept the guarantee of life and property.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-81'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-81'>[V-81]</a></span> According to Miguel García Granados, who in later years was a liberal
leader and acting president of Guatemala, Arce had remained unmolested at
his house in sight of the besiegers during the three days' attack. <i>Id.</i>, 103.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-82'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-82'>[V-82]</a></span> This was done pursuant to orders from the governments of the states.
So says Morazan himself, adding that the measure was in consonance with
his own views, to reduce the number of prisoners to a minimum, '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">y tenia
tambien por objeto poner en absoluta incapacidad de obrar á los principales
jefes que habian llevado la guerra á los Estados.</span>' <i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 16-17.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_V-84'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_V-84'>[V-84]</a></span> The federal authorities alleged that their soldiers only had 431 muskets,
and not 1,500, as demanded from them. <i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 236-9. Morazan
says that soldiers were allowed to leave the city with their arms, infringing
the 4th clause of the capitulation, and he could get only evasive answers.
<i>Apuntes</i>, MS., 17; <i>Arce</i>, <i>Mem.</i>, 58-9, 98-103, from which the conclusion will be
drawn that the charges against the federal party were not unfounded. <i>Montúfar</i>,
<i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 109-17. On this subject Morazan himself said: 'No one
was put to death, or had money exacted from him by me. The capitulation
was faithfully carried out, even after being annulled. Duty gave way to magnanimity,
and there was no cause to regret it. Not that there was no blood
to avenge, grievance to punish, and reparation to demand. Among many

was drawn up by Irisarri, who was not a soldier, though a colonel of
militia; the language was pure and elegant, but it was virulent and full of
sophistry. Irisarri also in several publications boasted of his courage in
having sent such a document. He must have known that it would not have
any effect on Morazan. The latter was a generous man. The effect would

banished; they were but few, and had not been active against the liberal
cause. The Bethlehemite hospitallers, who devoted their time to teaching
and to the care of convalescents, were also allowed to remain. The author of
<i>Mem. Rev. Cent. Am.</i>, 170, says that the exiled priests were on the passage
vilely treated, for they were allowed only sailors' rations. Montúfar confesses
that it is not likely that the 289 friars had the succulent viands that
were usually prepared for them in their convents, nor the dainty dishes they
were so often favored with from the nuns, beatas, and all the daughters of
confession. As for the archbishop, he journeyed with every comfort. Juan
B. Asturias, who made the inventory of his property, reported on 31st of Dec.,
1829, that $218 had been paid for a saddled mule to take the archbishop to
the coast; he was allowed $2,000 for the expenses of his journey, and $1,008.50
were given to the pages for conveying him and his effects. A person having

because he accepted a pension of $3,000 from the Spanish government at Habana.
Archbishop Casaus was later appointed to administer the vacant see
of Habana, and held the office till his death. The above-mentioned law was
revoked by the constituent assembly on the 21st of June, 1839, and Casaus

<p class='footnote'>
<i>Memorias para la Historia de la Revolucion de Centro América. Por un
Guatemalteco.</i> Jalapa, 1832. 16mo, 257 pp. The authorship of these memoirs
was attributed by well-informed men, namely, Morazan, ex-president
of Central America, and the distinguished statesman and diplomate of that
country, Lorenzo Montúfar, to Manuel Montúfar, who had been chief of staff
of the first president of the republic, Manuel José Arce. The work begins
with the geography and political and ecclesiastical divisions of the country,
accompanied with data on each of the states and territories; namely, Costa
Rica, Nicaragua, Poyais, Honduras, Salvador, Guatemala, and Chiapas, together
with some remarks on mining and other industries, military defences,
and financial condition. The political portion, as the author himself acknowledges,
is loosely put together, and lacks many necessary details, which he
attributes to absence from home when the first sheets went to the press.
He claims, however, to have impartially and correctly narrated the events
of Cent. Am. history from 1820 to 1829. This to some extent is true; nevertheless
there crops out in places class-bias, particularly in describing the
events from 1826 to 1829, by the ideas which prevailed in the moderado,
otherwise called servile, party, in which he was affiliated and serving, and for
whose acts he, like many others, was driven into exile after the defeat of that
party on the field of battle.

work purports to be a defence of his administration by the first president of
the republic of Central America, against what he calls the slanders heaped
upon his name by those who rebelled against the government and the nation,
with documents bearing on the revolts, the whole having been prepared while
the author was in exile. The book is a disconnected, disjointed patchwork,
incomplete in its various records of events, and indicates, as does Arce's career,
a weak character. A number of meaningless and inapt quotations from
the old classics and from law-books help to confuse the narrative still more.

from the port of Omoa. He had been Milla's chief agent and adviser, and
brought about the destruction by fire of Comayagua, his native place. This

Morazan to be elected. Morazan had in his favor the prestige of a victorious
general. He was somewhat in the position of Bonaparte when he returned
from Egypt. Valle was recognized to be the best informed man of Central
America; none could compete with him in literary or scientific attainments.
In politics he was always an opponent of the aristocracy, who execrated his
memory, and even impudently pretended to deny his literary merits. But
we have seen elsewhere that he was not, like Barrundia, an uncompromising
opponent of all governments not based on democracy and republicanism. He
compromised with the Mexican empire, was a deputy to the imperial congress,
where he made a brilliant record, and became a minister of the emperor, who
sent him to prison when he dissolved the congress. After the emperor's overthrow,
Valle maintained that the provinces of Central America were free to
act their own pleasure. He was a popular man, but Morazan's victorious
sword eclipsed all else just then. <i>Id.</i>, 268.

never did it. Arce recruited his men, issued proclamations, and built forts

to hinder the action of the government forces.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-22'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-22'>[VI-22]</a></span> It is understood they were jealous in Salvador of Guatemala's influence
in the federal policy. Cornejo claimed that what he wanted was reforms in
the national constitution. Reforms were certainly necessary, and if they had
been adopted in good faith by the states, the union might have been saved.
The executive had no participation in the framing of laws, either directly or
indirectly; he had not the sanction of them, nor could he veto or suspend.
It was the senate, as the council of the government, that sanctioned the laws.
That body, elected very like the chamber of deputies, was the judge of ministers
and other functionaries. It nominated the officials, and at the same
time had legislative, administrative, and judicial powers. The president of
the republic had no independent place of abode, and was ever at the mercy
of the state where the federal government had its seat; at best, he was the
object of that state's benevolent hospitality. On the other hand, he was the
target of all the assaults promoted by the spirit of localism for or against
that state. It was therefore evident that a federal district was a necessity;
one which the states would look upon as common property, and would foster
and advance.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-23'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-23'>[VI-23]</a></span> Galvez' record is not clean in the eyes of many liberals. He had belonged
to the imperial party, and had been leagued with the aristocracy. He
was a patriot, it is true, but his patria was Guatemala; his patriotism did not
embrace all Central America. Such is the opinion given of him, with his
portrait, by Montúfar, in <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 296.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-24'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-24'>[VI-24]</a></span> Besides, Cornejo had officially said that Morazan had neither supporters
nor prestige in Salvador.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-25'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-25'>[VI-25]</a></span> Galvez had wanted arrangements made to repel invaders, but leaving
Cornejo, though he disliked his indiscreet acts, in his position. Morazan

</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-27'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-27'>[VI-27]</a></span> Cornejo had consented to negotiate, believing the force on the frontier
to be controlled by Guatemala; but on ascertaining that it was under Morazan's
orders, and that Galvez had merely intended a mediation without being
recreant to his federal obligations, his commissioners broke off the conferences
under various pretexts.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_VI-28'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-28'>[VI-28]</a></span> It was a great mistake, perhaps, not to have given the state time to reflect,
when it might have gone back quietly to the union. As it was, liberals
were for the first time arrayed against liberals, and the shedding of blood
begat animosities that never could be healed. The serviles, of course, gladly
fanned the flame.

In 1827-8, Arce, Arzú, and Montúfar failed to do it with an equal, if not a
larger force. In 1832 Morazan with only 800 men made himself master of the
place in less than two hours. The object of these remarks was to show that
no credit should be given to Morazan's detractors in their attempts to lessen
his military reputation. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, i. 343.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-40'>[VI-40]</a></span> Pursuant to a resolution of the national congress of June 25, 1833.
As early as 1826 the government of Salvador had tried to have the federal
authorities reside at least 40 leagues from Guatemala. Similar requests had
been subsequently made by other states; and even in the legislature of Guatemala
reiterated motions had been presented to the same effect. But the federalist
party, as long as it was in the majority in congress, strenuously
opposed the removal, believing that it would bring about, as it actually did,
the downfall of the federal system, and the dissolution of the federal authorities.
<i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 34. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, ii. 58-9, remarks that
Marure when he wrote the first two volumes of his <i>Bosquejo Histórico</i> was
a liberal; in his <i>Efemérides</i>, written later, he speaks like a conservative. The
change of tone is attributed to the iron influence of the government from
whom he had a salary as a professor. Lastarría, in <i>La América</i>, 250, erroneously
attributes the transfer to Morazan's action to break up the influence of
the oligarchical party in Guatemala.

was not accepted by the states, except Costa Rica, which expressed assent
May 7, 1835. Squier, <i>Travels</i>, ii. 422, also says that only Costa Rica expressed
an acceptance of the proposed constitution, adding that the opposing
states wanted different, and in most cases irreconcilable, reforms. Montúfar,

Rica accepted the reforms.

badge of mourning three days; that the bells of the churches should be tolled
morning, noon, and eve of each day; that a portrait of Valle, contributed by
the members of the legislature, should be placed in its hall of sessions; and
that the other states should be requested to make manifestations of sorrow
for the loss of their distinguished statesman and savant. Salvador, on the 9th
of Apr., 1834, decreed similar honors. Marure, in his <i>Efemérides</i>, 35, bestows
the highest praise on Valle. '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Perdió Centro América, con el fallecimiento

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-51'>[VI-51]</a></span> B. Lambur, commissioned by Galvez, jefe of Guatemala, to report on
the origin and progress of the disease, wrote from Aceituno April 3d: 'There
can be no doubt that cholera came by way of Omoa to Gualan, thence went
to Zacapa and to Esquipulas, this last-named town being the focus whence it
has irradiated with such velocity to the towns at present infested.' Esquipulas
is a species of Mecca which people from all parts of Central America
and Mexico visit in January of each year, to worship an image of Christ, to
which countless miracles have been attributed. In the <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Boletin de Noticias del

muchos romeristas de Esquipulas.</span>' <i>Id.</i>, 351-3. The fact is, that the disease
had been doing havoc in the towns near the northern coast since Feb., and
gradually spread throughout the rest of the state and republic till toward the
end of the year, when it abated. The first case in the city of Guatemala occurred
on the 19th of April. The mortality in that city during the invasion
was 819, or a little over the 44th part of the population, which was much
smaller than in other less populated cities. <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 40. See also <i>Dunlop's

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VI-55'>[VI-55]</a></span> Tempsky, <i>Mitla</i>, 337, says that Carrera was born in Santa Rosa, misled
probably by the circumstance that the first Indian outbreak under his lead
occurred there. He was born about 1815 or 1816, and was the illegitimate
offspring of Antonio Aycinena, a member of one of the chief families of
Guatemala, and of Manuela Carrillo, a servant in the paternal mansion.
Through the influence of the Aycinenas he was immediately after his birth
adopted by one Juana Rosa Turcios, whose husband's name of Carrera the
boy subsequently was given. Such is the version of the author of a manuscript
written in July 1844, and entitled <i>Orígen de Carrera</i>, in <i>Morazan y
Carrera</i>, no. 4, 1 <i>et seq.</i>, the authenticity of which is made doubtful by some
inaccuracies in other statements, the object evidently being to give Carrera's
descent a little respectability. Stephens, <i>Cent. Am.</i>, i. 225, says that in
1829 he was a drummer-boy, leaving the army after the capture of Guatemala
by Morazan, and retiring to Mataquescuintla, where he became a
pig-driver, or, as Montgomery, <i>Guat.</i>, 143-4, has it, a dealer in hogs,
having risen in the federal army as high as corporal. Dunlop, <i>Cent. Am.</i>,
195, followed by <i>Crowe's Gospel</i>, 141, and <i>Squier's Trav.</i>, ii. 429, essentially
confirms Stephens' statements. Belly, <i>Nic.</i>, i. 75, adds that Carrera was for
a time employed in the plantation of a Frenchman named Laumonier, near
La Antigua. Montúfar says of him: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Un joven como de 25 años, sin ninguna
educacion, ni conocimientos de ningun género, pues no conocia siquiera
el abecedario. Los primeros años de su vida los empleó, ya de sirviente
doméstico, ya de apacentador de cerdos, ya de peon en los trabajos de
campo.</span>' The same authority refers to Milla's eulogies of Carrera, where
the words occur, '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carrera á pesar de su falta de educacion, y de los hábitos
de la vida del campo,</span>' which might have secured for Milla lodgings in the
dungeons of the castle of Guatemala. The same writer repeats the assertion
often made against the jesuit Paul, later bishop of Panamá, and raised to the
position of archbishop of Bogotá, that he said at Carrera's death, in his
funeral oration, that the man whose corpse was descending into the tomb was
on the right side of God the father. All repentant villains are given some such
post-mortem place by sympathizing ministers of the gospel.

he joined the discontented because the jefe Galvez refused him a high office
for one of his relatives. <i>Stephens' Cent. Am.</i>, i. 227. But looking over the
correspondence that passed between them in June 1837, the conclusion is
that the cause of the disagreement was not a personal one. Barrundia opposed
the convocation of the assembly to an extra session, and all the decrees
enacted by it. The correspondence produced much sensation. Galvez ended
accusing Barrundia of having adopted, when he was president of the republic,
some measures similar to those he had now censured. The most serious
charge against Barrundia was his persecution of Padre Rojas, to which the
former answered that the priest had been at the head of the insurgents who
proclaimed the Spanish domination on the Atlantic coast, and though outlawed
for that offence, was not executed. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, ii. 377-407.

the situation. Had the forces of the city, consisting of 411 men, been placed
under Morazan, they with those of Sacatepequez would have been too strong
for Carrera, and he would not have entertained the idea that a powerful party
looked to him for aid.

and was an intimate friend of Carrascosa and Carballo, believing that his
house would be a place of safety, induced the vice-president and his family to
use it. It so happened that a small force of Galvez entered the house, fired
upon the invaders from the windows and retired. The men fired upon were not
of the force from La Antigua, but some of Carrera's savage horde, called from
that time 'cachurecos,' who rushed into the house, fired upon the family, wounding
one of the women and a child, and killing José Gregorio Salazar, the vice-president.
Salazar was born in San Salvador in 1793, and had two brothers,
Cárlos, the general, and Francisco, who as a captain was killed in action on
the 23d of June, 1834. José Gregorio Salazar was one of the leaders in whom
Morazan reposed the highest trust. As senator, president of the senate, jefe
of Salvador, vice-president of the republic, and acting executive at such
times as Morazan assumed personal command of the troops, Salazar unswervingly
supported progressive principles. His portrait shows a fine and intelligent
face. The murder of the vice-president, instead of calling for execration
on the part of the priests, Duran, Lobo, Nicolás Arellano, Antonio Gonzalez,
and others, only brought out their diatribes against the victim. <i>Id.</i>, 576-9.

on the war and its consequences. In this document they say, among other
things, that it had been moved in the asamblea of Guatemala to authorize the
restoration of the archbishop and of the religious orders, to abolish divorce,
and to declare void the decrees of 1829, '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">decretos que sostuvieron entónces

Aycinena, and their confreres, fawned at his feet, covered him with flowers,
disgusted him with their flattery, feasted him to satiety, and patiently bore
his contemptuous rebuffs as long as they hoped to win him over. After their
failure, sarcasm, ridicule, and abuse were heaped upon him and his name.
Had Morazan's morals been equal to those of the serviles, he might have accepted

meant Old Guatemala, or La Antigua. Carrera, at Jalapa, had 2,000
men, while his opponent, Col Manuel Bonilla, had about 500. The latter
were nearly annihilated. The few officers and soldiers who escaped with
life found refuge in Salvador territory. Carrera's excesses at this time knew
no bounds. He not only ravished women, but amused himself cutting off their
tresses and ears. Some of these earless women entered the city of Guatemala,
and their stories produced great indignation. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, iii. 204;

no advantage was derived from such a glorious victory, and in a few days
vandalism became again menacing.' Salazar was blamed, Montúfar thinks
unjustly. According to him, the victorious troops were not in condition to
pursue. This authority, partly on the testimony of Gen. Carballo, lays the
blame on Rivera Paz, who had no interest in destroying a faction on which
his party relied in the emergency of Morazan refusing his aid to the serviles.
Morazan, on the 24th of Oct., declared martial law in portions of Guatemala,
peremptorily refused to listen to the proposals of the recalcitrants, and
marched to Guatemala, leaving the government in charge of the vice-president,
Diego Vijil, whom congress had chosen to succeed the murdered Salazar.

their disposal the requisite number of municipal districts. Their emissaries
supported the separation in Honduras and Nicaragua. Costa Rica was governed
by Carrillo, a declared foe to Central American nationality. They were

compact dissolved, and the resumption by the state of its absolute sovereignty.
This declaration was ratified by the constituent assembly on the 14th of June
of the same year. Guat. on the 11th of May entered into a treaty of amity
and alliance with Honduras; on the 5th of June, 24th of July, and 1st of Aug.,
made similar treaties with Salv., Nic., and Costa R., respectively. July 1st,
Hond. and Costa R. for the first time made a treaty of friendship and alliance
as sovereign states. Aug. 10th was signed at Quezaltenango the first treaty
of a similar nature between the new state of Los Altos and Salv. <i>Marure</i>,
<i>Efem.</i>, 48-50. Costa Rica had in Nov. 1838 assumed the plenitude of her
sovereignty. In obedience to a decree of Braulio Carrillo, the supreme chief
of the state, dated Aug. 4, 1838, her representatives and senators had left
their seats in the federal congress. The state recognized its share of the federal
debt and paid it at once. Carrillo's decree shows that the Costa Ricans
were dissatisfied with the inequality of their representation in the national
lower house, where Guatemala had 19 more deputies than Nicaragua, 17 more
than Honduras, 15 more than Salvador, and 23 more than Costa Rica, which
had only four representatives in the 'congreso,' as the lower house was called.
The representation in the senate was equal to that of the other states; but if
the latter chamber refused its sanction to any bill adopted, the former could,
under the 83d art. of the constitution, make it a law by three fourths of the
votes present. Thus was Costa Rica made a nonentity in the legislative body.
There were other reasons for complaint. By a good management of her
finances, Costa Rica always had available resources, and punctually paid her
contingent to the national treasury in money. She was therefore taxed
while virtually without representation. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, iii. 266-73,

went away with Morazan. Should any return, they must be given up to

the hands of his enemies, and he lost much of his property. He left the
country, but family affairs necessitated his return some years after. In his

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_VIII-54'>[VIII-54]</a></span> On the 28th of Jan. a body of Quezaltec troops, under Colonel Corzo,
was defeated by the Guatemalans, under Gen. Monterrosa. It had been stationed
in the hacienda of Bejucal, with the double object of guarding on the
coast side the territory of Los Altos, and of forming a combination with the
men of Salvador, who were about to invade Guatemala from the river Paz
frontier. The treatment of the fugitives by the Indians was shocking. Corzo
and Lieut-col Córdoba perished at their hands. Carrera, after defeating, on
the 29th of Jan., the Quezaltec troops that attempted to check him on the
heights of Sololá, entered Quezaltenango unresisted, and put an end to that
state. Its towns were taken under Guatemalan protection, on the fiction of
their voluntary annexation, by decree of Feb. 26, 1840. <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 52;

committed by the very people of Los Altos who rose against the partisans of
the government. The fact is, they were savage Indians under Carrera's protection.
This chief returned in triumph to Guatemala, and was received
amid the plaudits of his clerico-aristocratic supporters and the rabble. His
victorious army brought in the rear the armament and spoils of Quezaltenango,
and upwards of 100 prisoners, among them Guzman, Mariscal, and Soto. The
first named was wounded, and tied to a mule. The rabble made him the
special object of their scoff. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, iii. 439-41.

for his excessive generosity and abnegation, which, he declares, always
turned to the prejudice of that statesman and his party. He wanted his enemies
pardoned, and to enjoy all personal guarantees, but there was no spirit
of reciprocity on their part. When the serviles assumed the reins of power,
they invariably abused and persecuted Barrundia. He was not only sent into

order that the diocese should have a bishop, and permitted that he should
appropriate a portion of the public funds to that end. No mention was made
of the person who was to be bishop. The idea was to flatter the several
clergymen who were with Carrera hoping to earn a mitre. July 25th the
people were called to elect a constituent assembly, of not less than fifty members,
to reform, add to, or retain in whole or in part the constitution of Guatemala.
This decree was supported by the liberals, who foolishly believed that
their party would have the power to reconstitute the state. The serviles
hailed it, being sure of controlling the situation with Rivera Paz at the head of
the government, and three servile wings as his counsellors. Reactionary
deputies would be plentiful in the constitutional convention. The capitation
tax was reduced to four reales. The assembly, now converted into a law-maker
by steam, on the 26th of July revoked the laws establishing civil
marriage and divorce, freedom to bequeath property, reduction of the number
of holidays, and the further admission of religious vows. <i>Id.</i>, 190-2.

sulphur and a shower of fine white dust. The alarmed inhabitants closed
their doors and windows, but the dust could not be kept out. Breathing became
difficult. This lasted nearly three days. On the 23d, at 1 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, a
loud detonation, followed by heavy shocks of earthquake, rain of sand, and
total darkness, rendered the terror of the people complete. Flocks of birds
fell dead to the ground, and wild animals sought refuge in buildings. The
frightened inhabitants ran to their yards, or hurried to the churches to implore
divine mercy. Forty-three hours passed before the earth became quiet,
when a strong wind cleared the atmosphere, enabling the people to ascertain
the damage. The ashes in the vicinity of the volcano were several feet deep.
The river Chiquito had been wholly dried up, and two new islands were
formed. A large number of animals had perished, and the living ones were in
a state of starvation. Such had been the force of the convulsion that the
detonations and the rain of ashes had reached a distance of hundreds of
leagues, as far as Oajaca, Jamaica, and Bogotá in Colombia. Montúfar, <i>Reseña
Hist.</i>, ii. 145-50, in giving an account of the event, adds that the priests
called it a punishment from heaven because tithes had been abolished, freedom
of conscience proclaimed, and the decrees of 1829 and 1830 upheld.
The parish priests in several towns, during the prevailing darkness, preached
from their pulpits that this shaking of the earth was a manifestation of God's
wrath for the crimes of the liberals. Squier, <i>Trav.</i>, ii. 110-11, says that the
superintendent of Belize, on hearing the explosions, mustered his troops,
thinking that a battle was being fought somewhere near the coast. Stephens,

of Costa Rica accepted the decree on the 16th of July, 1838, and Carrillo
seized the opportunity to get rid of a fundamental law that did not suit him.

states were to be closed to British trade until Great Britain should restore to
Central America the island of Roatan, the seizure of which, together with
its consequences, is treated of in another part of this volume. Chatfield,
who had been favoring the views of Guatemala against Los Altos, declared
to the latter that these articles were offensive to his government. The government
of the new state, being anxious to avert any interruption of friendly
relations, by its minister, Aguilar, assured the consul, on the 18th of Jan.,
1840, that the objectionable articles would be rescinded.

the aristocrats of Guatemala, who spurned the idea of reorganization.

by one or more states in the internal affairs of the others. They
bound themselves never to resort to arms for the settlement of disputed
points, nor to permit the annexation of towns of alien jurisdiction without
the express assent of their sovereign. The other states of the late union
were granted the privilege of joining the confederacy with equal rights and
representation. Art. 14 prescribed that the government was to be exercised
through delegates for the general objects of common benefit expressly set
forth in the instrument. Art. 15. The executive authority was to be in charge
of a supremo delegado, with a consultive council formed with one member
from each state. Art. 16. The judicial power was intrusted to a court composed
of members chosen by the state legislatures. The delegates who

prominent man of the govt or of the aristocratic party had any knowledge of
his intention to invade, or of the source from which he obtained his supplies.
Pavon knew well enough, but prevarication was convenient. The fact is,
Juan A. Alvarado, Guatemalan agent in San Salvador, had given his government
timely information of the intended invasion. Arce's departure was
open. In order to put an innocent appearance on the affair, the govt decreed,
May 12, 1844, that Arce should leave the city within 24 hours, and the state
within 20 days. In an address to the people on the 2d of June, Rivera Paz
says that Salvador emissaries had been detected trying to rouse the people of
Los Altos to insurrection, and that the plan was intended to avenge the defeat
of 1840. This is hardly true; for Malespin had been then on Carrera's
side against Morazan, and his tool in Salvador ever since. The aristocrats
had, when it suited their purposes, published letters of liberal leaders falling
in their hands; and yet they never brought out those said to have been
taken from the emissaries at Los Altos.

Miguel, Salv. He entertained liberal ideas from his earliest political life.
His military service, under Morazan, began soon after the battle of Gualcho,
and he was present as a captain in the actions of San Miguel and Las Charcas.
He accompanied that leader to Guat. In the invasion of Cent. Am.
from Mex. by Arce in 1832, Guzman did gallant service at Jocoro, and entered
San Salvador with Morazan. Again during San Martin's rebellion he
served under his chief as a lieut-col. The chambers of Salvador, on the 19th
of May, 1845, declared Guzman a 'benemérito de la patria,' and awarded
him a gold medal, at the same time promoting him to general of division.

honor or courage. His manners are gentlemanly; he has no mixture of colored
blood, and is rather good-looking, though he appears to possess but little
talent or education.' I am inclined to think that Dunlop misrepresented
Guzman's character, for Guzman proved himself a good and pure ruler, and
his name is revered in the state and throughout Cent. Am. by all lovers of
freedom and enlightenment.

when the convents were closed in 1839, for which reason the government of
Guat. would not trust him. It was deceiving him. He was, however, the
one most likely to succeed in keeping Carrera from aiding Hond. in the present
emergency. Hond. had sent Felipe Jáuregui and Pablo Orellana to Guat.
The former was Ferrera's mentor, and in the councils of Pavon, Aycinena,
and Batres. At first he was alarmed at the liberalism of the constituent congress,
which had voted assistance to Salv. But he received assurances that
no aid would be sent except to quell revolts in the interior; and, moreover,
that the foes of Hond. would be stricken from the Salvador administration.
Jáuregui now understood the game, and wrote his government that the vote
of aid by congress practically amounted to nothing. A note containing these
assurances was published in Comayagua. Guat. concluded a treaty of friendship
and alliance with Hond. on the 19th of July, 1845. <i>Guat.</i>, <i>Recop. Leyes</i>,

Morazan's extraordinary powers, and on the 2d of Sept. adjourned to reassemble
April 1, 1843. Among the most noted acts of this convention were the
following: A vote of thanks and other honors to Morazan and Villaseñor, the
latter being awarded a gold medal with an honorable inscription. Morazan
was given the title of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Libertador de Costa Rica</span>; and on his refusing to publish
the decree, the assembly specially requested him to do so. The army
that brought about the change was honored with the name of <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Division Libertadora

agitated, and shedding tears for Morazan's end, his son-in-law, Irungaray,

early years he had been in the naval service, and acquired some skill as an
artilleryman. He married into a respectable family of San José, and had
numerous descendants. By the cultivation of coffee he made himself wealthy,
and this together with his connection with the Carrillo family enabled him to
attain the position of comandante general, and to link his name with some
important events. At his house the worst enemies of Morazan had always
been welcomed. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, iii. 647-8.

house of the Escalantes, amidst the deadly fire, she was taken by the enemy

Morazan's mortal foes.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-20'>[XI-20]</a></span> He would have met with no difficulty in obtaining security for Saravia,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-21'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-21'>[XI-21]</a></span> Herrera was a student when he gained this unenviable notoriety. He
afterward went to Guatemala to complete his studies, and was well treated
and much aided by Juan José Aycinena and Manuel F. Pavon; and he became
their most humble henchman. Returning to Costa Rica as a lawyer, he
was appointed after a while a justice of the supreme court. On many occasions
he proved himself unprincipled, treacherous, and contemptible.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-24'>[XI-24]</a></span> The Spaniard Espinach, a reactionist of some standing who acted as a
commissioner of the revolutionists, fearing that Morazan's popularity in Cartago
might bring on a counter-movement, and in order to avert it, asked
Morazan to instruct Cabañas to lay down his arms, and to command Saget to
deliver those he had in Puntarenas. He assured Morazan his life was in no
peril. His next step was to meet Cabañas at Chomogo, telling him Morazan
was leaving the state by the Matina road with sufficient money, and advising
him to disband his men. Cabañas was deceived, and went alone to Matina,
where he was taken prisoner.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-25'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-25'>[XI-25]</a></span> <i>Marure</i>, <i>Efem.</i>, 56. Saravia was a son of Miguel Gonzalez Saravia, the
governor of Nicaragua, who attached that province to Iturbide's empire, and
a grandson of General Saravia, president and captain-general of Guatemala,
who had been appointed viceroy of Mexico, and was shot by Morelos in Oajaca.
Young Saravia's mother, Concepcion Nájera y Batres, was of the leaders of
Guatemalan society, for which reason the aristocratic party expected much
from him. But after completing his education, with evidences of extraordinary
talents, he often gave expression to the most liberal ideas. Before being
admitted to the bar in 1834 he had served in the office of the secretary of the
senate, and later as a chief of bureau in the department of foreign affairs.
He afterward held a judicial appointment, being at all times noted for ability
and eloquence, as well as for his writings in <i>El Semanario</i>, which attracted
the attention of Morazan, who made him auditor de guerra of the federal
army. From that time Saravia followed Morazan's fortunes, taking part in
several actions of war, and thus attaining the rank of general. He was also
this leader's aide-de-camp, private secretary, and minister-general, both in
Salvador and Costa Rica. A portrait of the young general gives him quite a
distinguished air.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-26'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-26'>[XI-26]</a></span> Among them were Mariano Montealegre, Juan de los Santos Madriz,
and José M. Castro.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-27'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-27'>[XI-27]</a></span> The most virulent were Luz Blanco and Herrera. They even worked
upon the feelings of Pinto's family, and it is said that his daughter Petronila
imagined that she saw her father sent to the scaffold by Morazan, and fell in
a convulsion.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-28'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-28'>[XI-28]</a></span> Morazan had demanded a trial. He also desired to address a circular
to the governments of the states, but it was not permitted him.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-29'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-29'>[XI-29]</a></span> He declared that he had expended the whole of his own and his wife's
estate, besides $18,000 due to Gen. Bermudez, in endowing Costa Rica with
a government of laws. This was his sole offence, for which he had been condemned
to lose his life, which was further aggravated by a broken pledge,
for he had been assured by Espinach that his life would be spared. The
forces he had organized were originally intended to defend Guanacaste against
an expected attack from Nicaragua. Subsequently a number of volunteers
were detached for the pacification of the republic. He reiterated his love for
Central America, urging upon the youth of the land to imitate his example,
and fight to redeem her. He finally disclaimed any enmity or rancor toward
his murderers, forgiving them and wishing them every possible happiness.
In that instrument, says Barrundia, '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">se ve diáfana el alma, noble, tranquila,
y generosa del héroe que descendia á la tumba.</span>'

of Dec., were surrendered, according to Morazan's wishes, to Salvador, by
whose authorities they were received with high military and civic honors.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-32'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-32'>[XI-32]</a></span> The priest Juan José Aycinena, who was the minister of state, hated
Morazan with a deadly hatred from the day that his brother was defeated at
San Antonio. This animosity became more intensified, if possible, upon

Morazan said in his last will that his death was an assassination, as he had
not been allowed any form of trial. But the worthy padre and his accomplice
in iniquity, Carrera, attributed the crime to heaven, and made Rivera Paz,
chief of state, accuse providence of aiding Vicente Herrera and Luz Blanco in
its perpetration.

trouble at San José, went on board their ships at Puntarenas, thence
menacing the government. Subsequently arrangements were made for the
surrender of the arms and disbandment of the men, but owing to misunderstanding
were not carried out, and the expedition departed for La Libertad in

Nicaragua, against Salvador, because the latter, notwithstanding the treaties
of 1840 and 1842, and the protest to the contrary, had allowed Saget, Cabañas,
Barrios, and their companions, to reside in the state under the protection of
its laws. The first two named governments saw that for all they had manœuvred

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-68'>[XI-68]</a></span> The treaty was made at San José, Costa R., on the 15th of Apr., 1858,
and signed by José M. Cañas and Máximo Jerez, plenipotentiaries respectively
of Costa R. and Nic., and by Pedro Rómulo Negrete, mediator on the
part of Salv. The signatures of the secretaries of the three legations also
appear to the instrument. The ratifications were made in due form, and exchanged
by the two govts on the 26th of April, the same year. The treaty
was approved by the Nicaraguan constituent congress May 28th, and published
by President Tomás Martinez and his secretary of state, June 4th. Under
its 2d article the dividing line was to be as follows: Starting from the Atlantic
Ocean, the line to begin at the extreme end of Punta de Castilla, at the mouth
of the River San Juan, and continue on the right bank of that stream to a
point in waters below the Castillo Viejo, at three English miles from the outer
fortifications. Thence a curve was to commence, whose centre should be
those works, and distant therefrom in all its course three English miles, and
terminating at a point distant two miles from the bank of the river in waters
above the fort. Thence the line should continue in the direction of Sapoá
River, which empties into Lake Nicaragua, following a course invariably two
miles distant from the right margin of the San Juan River, with its curves
to its source in the lake, and from the right margin of the same lake to the
said Sapoá River, where this line, parallel to said margins, ends. From the
point where it may coincide with the Sapoá River, which must of course be
two miles from the lake, an astronomical line should be drawn to the central
point of the bay of Salinas on the Pacific Ocean, where the delimitation of
the two contracting powers will terminate. The 6th art. gives Nic. the exclusive
control over the waters of the San Juan River from its source in Lake
Nicaragua to the point where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean; Costa R.
retaining the right of navigation in said waters for trading purposes from the
mouth of the river to a distance of three English miles from the Castillo Viejo.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XI-70'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-70'>[XI-70]</a></span> Ayon did not pretend to deny that the treaty had been concluded by his
govt, and duly ratified by the legislative authority of the two republics. He
alleged that the fundamental law of Nic. established the limits of the state,
embracing within them the territory of Guanacaste; and that the treaty in
question ignored the Nicaraguan constitution, which prescribed that an amendment
of it by one legislature must be submitted to the next for ratification;
and this not having been done, there was a radical nullity. Costa R. replied
that the legislative ratification in Nic. had been, not by an ordinary legislature,
but by a constituent assembly fully empowered to amend the constitution
or frame a new one. It had been called to make a new fundamental law,
and therefore had a right to establish new boundaries. Moreover, that even
if that assembly had not possessed constituent authority, but had been a
merely ordinary congress, the fact still remained that a number of Nicaraguan
legislatures had held the treaty to be valid and unobjectionable. Some attempts
have been made in administration circles of Costa R., much against
public opinion, to annul the treaty, in order to have for a boundary line the
whole right bank of the San Juan, from Greytown or San Juan del Norte to
San Cárlos, and Lake Nicaragua to La Flor. Were this supported, and the
treaty set aside, the questions between Costa R. and Nic. would assume a
serious aspect. <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, ii. 231-4; <i>Ayon</i>, <i>Cuestion de Límites</i>,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XI-78'>[XI-78]</a></span> During the Walker war, a treaty was made at San José between P. A.
Herran for Colombia, and Joaquin B. Calvo for Costa Rica, which does not
follow the line on Molina's map. Modifications were made to it at Bogotá,
and ratifications were never exchanged. Later on José M. Castro went to
Bogotá and negotiated another treaty, which did not stipulate Molina's line.
This treaty was not ratified by either govt. The next attempt was made by
B. Correoso, on behalf of Colombia. His negotiations were mostly verbal,
disregarding arguments for the straight line between Punta de Burica and
the Escudo de Veraguas; and alleging that on the N., N. E., W., and N. W.
of that line were Colombian settlements, which, under the constitution of
his country could not be ceded. A treaty was entered into, however, which
did not obtain the ratification of either government. In Costa R. it was considered
a ruinous one. Correoso was charged in Colombia with having made
a damaging arrangement. <i>Pan.</i>, <i>Gaceta Istmo</i>, Oct. 20, 1841; <i>Id.</i>, <i>Crón. Ofic.</i>,

a difficult one. Morazan ruled in Costa Rica, had not a few friends
in Nicaragua, and public opinion in the latter state favored a convention of
states. On the other hand, he was anxious not to forfeit the good opinion of
the nobles and nuns. Upon the news of Morazan's execution reaching Leon,
he had it published with marks of satisfaction. He also objected, though not
strenuously, to the landing of Saget and his companions, ycleped Coquimbos,

cacique of Payais, gives with a portrait of that cacique, Sir Gregor MacGregor,
a historical preface, and a map of Mosquitia, and the Poyais territory. The
book also contains a descriptive sketch of that country, its productions, mode
of cultivation, and other facts, all compiled for the special use of settlers.
<i>Peter F. Stout's Nicaragua, Past, Present, and Future</i>, Phila., 1859, 12°, 372
p. With the exception of a cursory glance at affairs in Mosquito, on interoceanic
communication, and ancient history of Mexico, this work is confined
to the resources, history, and general features of Nicaragua, the chief object
being to furnish a general description of the country rather than its history.
The author was U. S. vice-consul, and his opinion on questions between his
country and Great Britain might be deemed by a subject of the latter not
wholly impartial. <i>Orlando W. Roberts' Narrative of Voyages and Excursions

Leon, with an index and a preface by Edward Irving, is a little book descriptive
of the author's journey up the San Juan River to Leon through Lake
Nicaragua, and of trading voyages in which he was many years engaged
among the Indians of Hond., Nic., and Costa R. His opportunities for observation
seem to have been good, and his manner of setting forth the information
thus obtained is clear and apparently reliable. On Mosquitia and her
govt and people he gives much that is really interesting and useful. <i>R. H.

parts. The first treats of the Spanish dominions in North America; the
second of those in South America. Everything is treated in a cursory manner,
and the part relating to Cent. Am. and the isthmus of Panamá is meagre
and trifling.

Nic. territory; that he had himself notified the govt of Cent. Am. of the
existence of the Mosq. nation, and that Great Britain would not look with
indifference upon any usurpation of the territory of a monarch with whom
she had close relations; that Spain had recognized the Mosq. nation when
Prince Stephen visited San Salvador and Guatemala. His letter was dated
Oct. 24, 1842. Further correspondence followed between Nic. and Chatfield
without the former giving way to his pretensions. The whole correspond.

wanted a protectorate of Great Britain over Cent. Am., and it was believed
in Nic. for a while that Costa R. had given way to the influence of Pavon,
Chatfield, and J. J. Flores of Ecuador, and had accepted the scheme. Chatfield
having concluded, on the 26th of Nov., 1849, a treaty with Costa R.,
attempted on the strength of it, on the 1st of Dec., to dictate to Nic. He
said that differences between Nic. and Costa R. must be amicably arranged in
the understanding, that other means would not be looked on with indifference
by Great Britain.

first time a protectorate over the Mosquito shore was asserted by Great Britain.
Chatfield and Walker had claimed rights over the entire eastern coast,
from Cape Honduras to Chiriquí Lagoon, an extent of 700 miles, but Palmerston
set the limits 'from Cape Honduras down to the mouth of the river San
Juan.' Meantime the Nicaraguan authorities had obtained, Oct. 28, 1847,
from the Princess Inez, believing her the heir of Robert Charles Frederick, a
full recognition of the authority of Nic. over the shore of Mosq., and her command
to all interloping foreigners to leave the country. The British officials
of course paid no heed to this arrangement. <i>Squier's Cent. Am.</i>, 644-6; <i>Salv.</i>,

and modern Nicaragua, it gives a review of the topography, climate, natural
productions, government, people, and their institutions. The writer's information
on the country's physical peculiarities may be set down as useful,
though some deficiency is noted; but that on the political and administrative
branches is unreliable, showing him to have had but little knowledge of Central
American politics. He evidently had not the documents upon which to
form a correct judgment. The question of a canal across the isthmus of Nicaragua
is also reviewed, and a résumé of its history given. The last general
treaty with the U. S. was negotiated in 1867. There was also a convention
for the extradition of criminals in 1871. Nic. has made arrangements to pay

Ephraim George Squier, whose works I have often quoted, was born in
Bethlehem, in the state of New York, June 17, 1821, and devoted most of
his life to civil engineering, journalism, and the pursuit of science, winning
for himself a distinguished name as an archæologist and author. His first
distinction was awarded him for his labors on the archæology of the Mississippi
Valley and the state of New York. Having been appointed in 1849
chargé d'affaires to the states of Central America, he employed much of his
time in gathering data upon those countries, which he afterward embodied in
several books. In 1853 he was engaged in the survey of a route across Honduras,
and organized a company for the construction of an interoceanic railway.
In 1863 and the following year he was employed by the U. S. govt as
a commissioner in Peru for the adjustment of claims against that republic, and
then devoted several months to the exploration of ancient monuments in that
country. In 1868 he was for a time U. S. consul-gen. to Hond. He visited
Europe several times both for pleasure and business. In addition to the works
that will be herein enumerated, he contributed many papers on antiquities and
other subjects to American and European scientific periodicals. The following
list comprises his principal works, most of which have been translated into
several languages: <i>Monuments of the Mississippi Valley</i>, being vol. i. of the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge; <i>Aboriginal Monuments of the state of
New York</i>, in vol. ii. of the Smithsonian Contributions; <i>Antiquities of the state
of New York</i>, with a supplement on the antiquities of the west; <i>The Serpent
Symbol, or Worship of the Reciprocal Principles of Nature in America</i>;
<i>Waikna, or Adventures on the Mosquito Shore</i>, under the pseudonym of Samuel
A. Bard; <i>Question Anglo-Américaine</i>; <i>Report of the survey of the Honduras
interoceanic railway</i>; <i>Monograph on authors who have written on the aboriginal
languages of Central America</i>; <i>Tropical fibres and their economic extraction</i>;
<i>Is cotton king? Sources of cotton supply</i>; <i>Incidents of Travel and Explorations
in the land of the Incas</i>. Other works of this author quoted in my
volumes on Central America are: <i>Notes on the states of Honduras and Salvador</i>,
with maps and illustrations, which gives valuable data on those countries.
In treating of diplomatic relations he expatiates on manifest destiny
and British intrigues, his conclusions not being probably palatable to the subjects
of the British crown, and others disposed to oppose the absorption of
more territory, or the exercise of exclusive influence by the U. S. The maps
drawn by Hitchcock under Squier's directions are the best that to that time
had been published. <i>Travels in Central America, particularly in Nicaragua</i>,
N. Y., 1853, 8vo, 2 vol., pp. 424 and 452, maps and cuts, contains a description
of aboriginal movements and scenery, together with a concise account of
the history, agricultural and other resources, of Nicaragua, the language,
manners, and customs of the people, with illustrations of the principal buildings,
towns, ports, etc. The work also describes at length the proposed canal
route, setting forth its advantages. The author had every facility as U. S.
chargé d'affaires to obtain the most exact data, and used them conscientiously
and with marked ability. <i>Nicaragua, its people, scenery, monuments, and the
proposed interoceanic canal</i>, Lond., 1852, N. Y., 1856, 2 vol. This work is
similar in all respects to—in fact a reprint of—<i>Travels in Cent. Am.</i> Another
edition under the aforesaid title appeared in New York, 1860, 1 vol. of pp.
691, which with the exception of about 18 pp. in the append., and a few more
illustrations, was similar to <i>Trav. in Cent. Am.</i> <i>The States of Central America</i>,
N. Y., 1858, 8vo, p. 782, maps and illust. The author issued in 1855, with
the title of <i>Notes on Central America</i>, an 8vo vol. of 397 pages, with maps and
cuts, intended to serve as a basis for this more extensive one, which treats of
the physical peculiarities, population, productions, commerce, and other
resources, political organization, aborigines, etc., of the country in general,
and of the states separately, and also of Belize, the Bay islands, and
Mosquito shore. Squier was evidently conversant with his subject. The
style is vivid and interesting, as well as instructive, and the statements, as a
rule, worthy of acceptance. In his treatment of diplomatic affairs between
Great Britain and Cent. Am., in which his own country was interested on
the side of the latter, he espouses the Central American side with so much
warmth as to awaken a suspicion that his judgment may have been warped
by his patriotism. The question of an interoceanic railroad having engrossed
public attention since the publication of this work the author felt justified in
reproducing, under the title of <i>Honduras</i>, Lond., 1870, 12<span class="sup">o</span>, 278 pp., with a
map, in a more compact and accessible form, a description of this country.
With the exception of a fuller information on the route, and its alleged advantages
over all others, and an appendix relating to immigration, the contents
of the book have been fully treated in the bibliographical notice on the
<i>States of Cent. Am.</i>
</p>

<p class="footnote">
<i>Report to the Directors of the Honduras Interoceanic Railway</i>, Lond., 1858,
fol., 102 pp. and map. Fours years previously a preliminary report was published
on this subject, and in 1857 another containing no additional information,
but in the appendix were given further correspondence and the charter
in full. The present work gives a complete report with all details, presenting
valuable statistics, and evidences of the feasibility of the proposed railway.
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Compendio de la Historia Política de Centro-América</span></i>, Paris, 1856, 12<span class="sup">o</span>, pp. 7-114,
as the title implies, is an outline of the political history of Central
America from 1821 to 1851, that is to say, a sketch of the revolution and
struggle between republicans on one side and monarchists on the other, by
which Central America was annexed to Mexico, and of the subsequent wars
between the federalists and the oligarchs, which culminated in the destruction
of the federation, and the ultimate rise to unrestricted power of the latter
with Carrera as their chief as well as tool. <i>Translation with notes of the letter
of Don Diego de Palacio (1576) to the crown of Spain on the provinces of Guatemala,
San Salvador, etc.</i>, N. Y., 1860, sq. 8<span class="sup">o</span>, pp. 132, is a report which in Spanish
bears the title of <i>Carta dirigida al rey de España</i>, and was addressed by
Palacio, a member of the royal audiencia of Guatemala, to the king, giving an
account of the ancient provinces of Guazacapan, Izalco, Cuzcatlan, and Chiquimula,
together with their languages, customs, and religion of their aboriginal
inhabitants, and a description of the ruins of Copan. Palacio evidently
collected this information by order of his sovereign, and showed himself an
intelligent as well as a kindly, well-meaning man; somewhat superstitious,
but less so than most men of his time. His narrative is both readable and
instructive, and his description of the ruins of Copan extremely interesting,
its correctness being established in after years by the accounts of Fuentes
and Stephens. Squier added numerous and interesting notes, but his translation
is in places open to criticism, partly for erroneous meanings given to
words, and partly for a not strict adherence to the spirit of the original. The
book, though a beautiful specimen of typography, is disfigured with many
misprints. Besides these I have in my library numerous valuable documents
in manuscript relating to Central American history, from the earliest days
after the Spanish conquest, which Mr Squier gathered from various sources
and never published.

<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A Travers L'Amérique Centrale. Le Nicaragua et le Canal Interocéanique</span></i>,
Paris, 1867, 8<span class="sup">o</span>, 2 vol., maps, 427 and 480 pp., by Félix Belly, who was the
director-general of a French canal company for opening a Nicaragua route.
He was also a chevalier and a well-known writer. To him had been intrusted
the task of obtaining a charter from Nicaragua for this canal, and with this
object he visited Central America in 1858, obtained the charter, and made
the necessary explorations for routes and resources. The delays and uncertainty
of the undertaking caused Belly to visit the country more than once,
and he thus became well acquainted with its resources, people, government,
and institutions generally. This information he imparts in connection with
the narrative of his journey and in articles, under the respective states, given
in the first volume. The second volume is wholly devoted to the interoceanic
projects, and particularly to a detailed history of his own canal scheme. The
style is attractive, the observations clever, and the information excellent. A
second edition, a reprint, appeared in 1870. <i>Belly</i>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carte d'études</span>, etc.</i>, Paris,

March 17, 1849. It is astonishing that an ignorant man like Paredes could
so easily hoodwink Luis Molina and the rest. They soon opened their eyes
to see the falseness of the man they had elevated from the command of a battalion
to the chief magistracy, and who was on the point of consummating his
treachery. Guzman saw through his plan, and escaped out of the city with a
number of his Quezaltec officers and men, and succeeded in reaching Salvador.
He first joined the mountaineers, and aided them to take Jutiapa, but
on seeing the outrages of Leon Raymundo, he left them in disgust.

to go away. He wished to visit San Salvador, but could not face Vasconcelos,
and went to Ahuachapan. Ex-president Escobar, who, as president of
the assembly, signed the proscription act of Oct. 13, 1848, died in exile, poor

Carrera caused to be shot some time afterward, and Lorenzo Montúfar, the

that forces of Guatemala were about to invade the department of Sonsonate,
with the view of inciting the inhabitants to rebel against their government.
Again, Jan. 10, 1851, he sets forth the motives actuating the oligarchs, who
had Carrera for their tool, and British Consul Chatfield for their ally, which
were to destroy Central American liberties, and to domineer over the other
sections. <i>Cent. Am. Pamph.</i>, vi. nos. 2 and 3.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XIII-75'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIII-75'>[XIII-75]</a></span> The objective point was the city of Guat., which the allies felt sure of

killed and 42 wounded. That was probably one of his characteristic falsehoods.

assembly composed of the house of representatives, the archbishop,
justices of the supreme court, and the members of the council of state. He
might be reëlected. Before being placed in possession of the executive office,
he was to be sworn by the archbishop who presided, for the occasion, over
the house of representatives. The executive was clothed with almost absolute
powers, being authorized, among other things, to issue, in accord with
the council of state, decrees having the force of law, to raise loans, declare
war, make peace, ratify treaties, etc. In the event of his death or permanent
disability, the executive duties devolved temporarily on the ministers in their
order of seniority; and in default of them, on the members of the council;
until the house of representatives, to be forthwith summoned, could meet and
make a choice in general assembly. During temporary absences of the president,
the government devolved on the council of ministers. The council of
state was formed of the cabinet ministers, eight members chosen by the congress,
and such others as the executive might appoint. They held office for
four years and might be reëlected. The following functionaries might also be
called by the executive to take part in the deliberations and vote, namely:
the archbishops, bishops sojourning in the capital, regente of the supreme
court, president of the ecclesiastical chapter, rector of the university, prior of
the consulado, president of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">sociedad económica</span>, and comandante general.
The house of representatives consisted of 55 deputies elected for four years.
The cabinet ministers had seats in the house, which was to open its session
Nov. 25th, and close it Jan. 31st. The administration of justice was intrusted
to a supreme and lower courts. The former consisted of a regente,
six justices, and one fiscal or attorney-general, all chosen by the congress for
four years, one half being renewed every two years, but all might be reëlected.

privilege of selecting his successor, and that other amendments should be
made to the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">acta constitutiva</span>, as permitted by its 15th art. It is understood
that at the meeting of officials in the capital there was but one dissentient
vote to the proposition. He had in a manifesto of June 22d expressed a weak
objection to the proposed change, but it was evidently a preconcerted plan of
the aristocrats and the military element. <i>Guat.</i>, <i>Gaceta</i>, May 12 to Sept. 15,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XIV-8'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIV-8'>[XIV-8]</a></span> It was this govt that rejected Morazan's proposals when he appeared at
La Union. While appreciating his patriotic purposes, it could not disregard
its obligations toward the other states. Hence, together with Malespin, it

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XIV-11'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIV-11'>[XIV-11]</a></span> Even Malespin had favored the act of the govt; for though uncultured,
 he was a Salvadoran; and now that Morazan was dead, he began to listen to
the advice of his more enlightened fellow-citizens, and to understand the
Machiavelism of Aycinena, Pavon, and their ally Chatfield.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XIV-12'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIV-12'>[XIV-12]</a></span> J. J. Aycinena repeatedly said that the revolt could not be quelled, and
it were better to accede to the wishes of the volcaneños. This will explain the
object of a doc. dated Oct. 18, 1843, and published at Comayagua at the govt
printing-office under the signature of Manuel José Arce. The ex-president had
taken advantage of an amnesty decree to return to Central America. He was
now very old, but still ambitious of power. In that manifesto, addressed to
the states of Cent. Am., he endeavors to demonstrate the necessity of their
again uniting under one govt. He spoke of Guzman and Malespin trying to
hold power for life; of intrigues to make the latter president, even if some of
his opponents had to be shot; of abuses he had been subjected to; the war
those men were planning, with the aid of Nic., against Guat. and Hond., on
the false charge that Carrera intended to annex Salv. to Guat. He accused
Malespin of atrocities, and yet praises Carrera, who placed Malespin in Salv.
The full text of the manif. is in <i>Montúfar</i>, <i>Reseña Hist.</i>, iv. 222-5.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XIV-13'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XIV-13'>[XIV-13]</a></span> The min. of state, Agustin Morales, reminded him that freedom of the

threatened to refer the subject to his govt, and was told to do so, not failing
to accompany the answers he had received.

restrictive clauses in it.

Vasconcelos was a partisan of Central American unification for various reasons,

and Pavon on one side, and Vasconcelos on the other. In 1849, the latter
was made to appear before the other states as an innate foe of Guat., whose
debasement and destruction he strove for. The govt of Salv. gave explanations

nor over 60; must have been a resident of the state for the five years preceding
the election, and own property within the state worth at least $8,000.
He had to receive an absolute majority of votes; otherwise congress should
choose one of the two candidates having the largest number of votes. Term

Tegucigalpa to take lessons on the violin; but the boy made no progress in

against his usurpation of powers, and appealed to the British government
and parliament, obtaining some trifling relaxation. They also petitioned that
the government should openly assume the sovereignty, so that they might
possess their lands without reservation in respect to Spain or Mexico. Their
petitions did not receive any direct reply. However, the govt in 1845, sent

man of fiendish instincts, but popular with his soldiers, whom he indulged in
every way. He possessed all the vices and was guilty of about all the crimes
known to man. When in his cups he would order men to be shot by way of
pastime. At the mention of his approach to a town, the inhabitants would
flee to the woods. He was the tiger of Cent. Am. <i>Dunlop's Cent. Am.</i>, 237;

<i>Explorations and Adventures in Honduras</i>, New York, 8vo, 588 pp., with maps
and illustrations, went to Honduras with the object of obtaining from her
government leave to work gold placers, and of opening commercial relations.
He visited several places, both in Nicaragua and Honduras, which he describes
quite accurately, together with the manners and customs of their
inhabitants. His information on mines and mining is valuable. There are
in the work three chapters devoted to history from 1821 to 1857, the groundwork
of which is mostly from other authors, and one chapter is filled with
data on commerce, revenue, debt, etc., and still another treats of coins and
currency, weights and measures, and productions, with illustrations. The
style is good, the work readable and instructive. Portions are evidently
taken from Squier, and the illustrations are mostly identical with those
of Squier's <i>States of Central America</i>. The same author gave to the press
in New York, a 12mo, with 316 pp., map and portrait, under the title of
<i>Walker's Expedition to Nicaragua</i>. This work, as the title implies, is almost
entirely devoted to Walker's career in this country, which is justified as well as
praised. Here and there he mentions some historical facts on British pretensions
in Mosquito, a short résumé on Nicaragua, the Nicaragua transit route,
and a short review on colonization, commerce, and mining, compiled from
several sources. There is no system or arrangement, having been, as the
author alleges, 'written, published, and put in circulation in twenty days,' a
feat few authors would go out of their way to boast of. But taken all in all,
the book is well worth perusing.

held on the 6th of Sept., 1855, the necessity of establishing a provisional government
for the maintenance of peace and order was recognized, and Kinney
was chosen civil and military governor to rule by and with the advice of a
council composed of five persons. Among the resolutions was one adopting
as a basis to regulate the action of the govt, the former constitution of San
Juan del Norte, or Greytown, which was modelled after that of the U. S. with
a few exceptions. Kinney did not hold the position long. He was disappointed
in his expectations, and resigned; he afterward visited Granada, and
at William Walker's instance an order of expulsion was issued against him.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVI-6'>[XVI-6]</a></span> William Walker was born in Nashville, Tenn., in 1824, being of Scotch
descent. After receiving a classical education, he studied law, and later followed
the medical profession for a time in Philadelphia. He then travelled
in Europe one year, and on his return was connected with some of the important
newspapers of the country, north, south, and west. Tiring of that, he
successfully practised law in Marysville, Cal. In 1852 he visited Guaymas,
and from the operations of Count Raousset, conceived the plan of creating
with adventurers from California independent republics in some of the
sparsely populated territories of Mexico. Hence his expeditions to Sonora
and Lower Cal., of which I give full accounts in my vol. on the north-western
states of Mex. Few persons, unacquainted with Walker, would suspect the
presence of so much ability and energy beneath his plain exterior. He was
but little more than 5 ft. 4 in. in height, with a rather dull and slow appearance;
a man of few words, though an attentive listener, his aspect was
that of a serious, thoughtful person. A remarkable feature of his face was a
deep, intensely brilliant blue-gray eye, large and intelligent. Sincere and
devoted to his friends, says a devoted adherent, his enmity, though not
violent, was not easily appeased. He was indifferent to personal ease and
comfort, and to the acquisition of wealth. <i>Wells' Walker's Exped.</i>, 21-3, 199-201.
He was not incapable of lofty conceptions, and possessed courage and
abnegation; but there was little of what might be called genius about him,
though his mind was sufficiently unbalanced in certain directions to give him
a title to that distinction. He wished to be a great man like Cæsar or Napoleon,
but the elements of that quality of greatness were absent. He might
have carved for himself a career of honor and usefulness, but for the restless
ambition that possessed him to attain a place among the notabilities of the
world, even by a disregard of law and justice. The idea of manifest destiny,
so prevalent among his countrymen, which implied the conquest of the Latin
race in America by the Anglo-Saxon, afforded him, as he imagined, the opportunity
for attaining the coveted renown, and at the same time securing,
through his instrumentality, the future happiness of Spanish America. But
unfortunately for him, he committed, at the inception of his career in Nic.,
acts which alienated him the men who had invited him to coöperate in the
consolidation of democratic principles; and some of his later measures, whatever
may be thought of his earlier ones, savored of recklessness, and of disregard
for the good opinion of mankind.

on Muñoz, who had apprised Corral of the intended operations, and had induced
Ramirez to forsake him during the action. He demanded an investigation
into Muñoz' conduct, and if it were not granted he would quit the service.
Castellon informed him in reply that in the present critical condition of the
democratic cause it was unadvisable to displease Muñoz. After much correspondence
and negotiation, Walker agreed to continue his services.

author's work is a historical account of the civil war in Nicaragua, in the years
1854-5, during which latter year the filibuster chief, William Walker, appeared
on the scene, taking part with one of the two parties to the strife, and
temporarily destroying the power of the other. The political and military
events of this period are concisely though vividly depicted, so that the reader
may become fully informed on the mode of carrying on the war, and on the
miserable condition of the country, as well as bitter animosity exhibited by
the opposing parties. <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Memorias para la Historia de la Campaña Nacional

ending with a short account of Walker's two other attempts to invade Central
America. Perez took a part in the operations against Walker, and later

the victory of San Jacinto, a hacienda, north of the plain of Oscotal,
distant one day's march from Granada. It was only a small affair in reality—120
riflemen under Byron Cole on one side, and 160 natives under Col D.
Estrada on the other—but it was important in its effects. Cole was captured
and killed, this being the end of the founder of filibusterism in Nic. Twenty-seven
riflemen were slaughtered; and the Nicaraguans had 55 killed and
wounded. <i>Nic.</i>, <i>Boletin Ofic.</i>, Sept. 26, 1856.

men by sickness. Several of his chief officers having died at about the same
time, it was imputed to the natives selling poisoned edibles. A letter of Feb.
16, 1857, has it that Walker received 4,600 recruits since June 1855. The
author sets down his deserters at 500, and his dead at no less than 3,600,
there being from 1,500 to 2,000 buried in Granada. <i>Pan. Star and Herald</i>,
Feb. 17, 1857; <i>Hayes' Scraps</i>, <i>Angeles</i>, ii. 255. However, an official report of
P. R. Thompson, Walker's adj.-gen., dated Feb. 24, 1857, has the following
figures, which do not seem to express the whole truth, as it might have been
injudicious to have the real facts made known. Original number of men
enlisted 2,288, of whom 61 were officers. Totals of death, 685, of whom 109
were officers; 37 resigned; 206 discharged; 9 dropped; 293 deserted, including

and after conferring with the Brit. officer, occupied Punta de Castilla, securing
the war material. He then tendered the men a passage to the U. S. at
the expense of Costa R. This was the end of the famous Lockridge expedition.

the 16 officers of his staff were to leave Rivas with side-arms, pistols, horses, and
other personal effects, under Davis' guaranty that they should not be molested
by the enemy, but allowed to embark on the <i>Saint Mary's</i> at San Juan del
Sur, whence she should convey them to Panamá; 2d. The other officers of
Walker's army would leave Rivas, with their arms, under the same guaranty,
and be sent by Davis to Panamá in charge of an officer of the U. S.; 3d. The
rank and file, citizens and officials, both the wounded and well, were to surrender
their arms to Davis on a vessel apart from the deserters, so that there
should be no contact between the former and the latter; 4th. Davis pledged
himself to obtain for Central Americans then in Rivas permission to remain
in their country with protection of life, liberty, and property; 5th. The officers
should be allowed to remain at San Juan del Sur, under the protection of the
U. S. consul, until an opportunity offered to leave for Panamá or San Francisco.

engaged in trade and mining without taking part in the political agitations
of his native place until the revolution of 1854, which did not meet his approval.
It is believed that his reserve had made him an object of suspicion
on the part of the democrats, which circumstance forced him to seek a refuge
in the ranks of the conservatives, and to embrace, much against his liking,
the military profession. Martinez was a lineal descendant of an heroic woman,
Rafael Mora, who in 1780 distinguished herself in the defence of San Juan
del Norte against Nelson's attack. He was in 1857 about 45 years old, tall
of stature, and of reserved deportment. Self-instructed, plain, and unambitious
of popularity, he cared not for honors or display, and abhorred sycophancy.
He never used more words than were necessary to express his
thoughts, and his whole aim, after he entered public life, was to serve his
country. Moreover, he possessed a kindly disposition, and in his family relations
was affectionate.

was constituted in three branches; namely, executive, legislative, and
judicial. The executive authority was vested in a president for four years,
without reëlection for the next term. In his absence or inability, the office
was to go into the hands of the senator called by congress to fill it. The
president was to be a native and resident of Nic., 30 years of age or upwards,
not having lost the rights of citizenship within five years of the election, and
possessing real estate valued at no less than $4,000. The legislative power was
to consist of a senate and house of deputies. The senators' term was to be of
six years; they were to be at least 30 years old, and to possess no less than
$2,000 in real estate, one third of their number to be renewed every two years.
The deputies were to be upwards of 25 years old, and hold for four years, one
half their number being renewed every two years. The natives of the other
Central American states were eligible to the senate or house, after a residence
in Nic. of ten or five years respectively. No churchman could be chosen president,
senator, or deputy. The justices of the supreme court had to be lawyers
of recognized ability and integrity. They were to hold office four years,
the members being renewed every two years. The court was divided into
two sections with at least four justices each. The constitution recognized
liberty of thought, speech, writing, and the press; also the rights of property
and emigration. Torture in any form, cruel punishments, confiscation of property,
invasion of private domicile, and establishment of special courts were
strictly forbidden. It was promulgated Sept. 15, 1858. <i>Rocha</i>, <i>Cód. Legis.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XVIII-7'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-7'>[XVIII-7]</a></span> Political grievances and private animosities were brought into action for
his overthrow. He was accused of intending to keep himself in power for
life, like Carrera in Guatemala, as was evidenced by his second reëlection,
which violated both the spirit and letter of the national institutions; of his
having imposed the weight of his own will on the financial department, the
judiciary, and even the legislature, with the view of setting up the rule of one
family over the ruins of republican liberty; of his having usurped the property
and labor of others for his own benefit. Even the organization of an army,
and his campaign against Walker, were made to appear as intended to improve
his own pecuniary interests, which were said to be in a very bad state.
The charge of assumption of dictatorial powers does not seem to be sustained
by facts. The opposition journal, the <i>Album Semanal</i>, freely published strong
articles against his administration. Pamphlets filled with vituperation, and
traducing his character, circulated without hindrance; one of the publications
called him the tzar of Costa Rica. This opposition was fanned by the
hatred of persons who had private grudges against Mora. Among them
Vicente Aguilar, his former partner, who had been made to disgorge $100,000
or more, of which he had wrongfully deprived Mora. Capitalists were hostile
because the president had chartered a bank. The sale of a tract of public
land near San José, upon which many persons had settled, was made the subject
for much trouble. The exile of the bishop did not fail to have a powerful
influence. Bishop Llorente had refused to pay, or to allow his clergy to
pay, an equitable tax decreed by congress Sept. 29, 1858, for the support of
hospitals. He not only refused compliance, but incited the populace to revolt.
For this he was expelled. He was, however, after Mora's overthrow, recalled
by the provisional government, and ruled the diocese till his death, which
took place Sept. 23, 1871. <i>Costa R.</i>, <i>Mem. Interior</i>, 1859, 9; 1860, 4; <i>Id.</i>, <i>Col.

<i>Le Nicaragua</i>, i. 379-81. One of the publications which came out after Mora's
downfall, not only charged him with abuse of power, peculation, and almost
every conceivable offence, but of his having brought himself into political
prominence by intrigue, and by treachery to Morazan, and to his relations
and friends, who, it was asserted, had been ruined by him. This publication
is dated San José, April 2, 1860, but is anonymous. <i>Costa R.</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Expos. ... Motivos

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-9'>[XVIII-9]</a></span> The govt was divided into three branches—legislative, executive, and
judicial—each independent of the others. The legislative was vested in a
congress of two chambers, the senate and house of representatives, and was
to meet once a year in ordinary session, and also to hold extraordinary sessions
when called for specified purposes. The senate was composed of two
senators for each province; the house was composed of deputies chosen by
the provinces in the ratio of population. The term of the members of both
houses was fixed at four years. The executive authority was vested in a
president for three years, without reëlection for the immediate following
term. He had a council of state to deliberate upon such affairs as the executive
referred to it for advice. The judiciary consisted of a supreme court,
and such other lower courts as might be established by law. None but a
native citizen, in full possession of his civil and political rights, could be president,
or member of the supreme court. Churchmen were ineligible. <i>Costa

Guanacaste, now called Moracia, and failed. A decree of outlawry was
issued against them Jan. 20, 1860, and their property was made amenable for
the government's expenses. Another insurrection took place in Esparza with
the same result, the govt issuing a decree of similar nature Sept. 16th, and
on the 18th another, suspending the constitution. This last decree was revoked
March 18, 1861. <i>Id.</i>, xvi. 153-4, 188, 218-21; xvii. 9.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XVIII-24'>[XVIII-24]</a></span> Castro's enemies averred that his course was very mysterious, and some
even suspected an intention on his part to retain power in his hands, though
he supported the candidacy of his minister, Julian Volio. They said that the
barracks assumed a menacing attitude, and Castro was on the point of decreeing
several military promotions of members of his own family, and concentrating
all the forces of the republic in and about his own residence. It
came to be believed that he intended to nullify Salazar first, and Blanco
next. But the former had in his favor most of the wealthy families, as well
as a large support in Alajuela, Heredia, and Cartago. To make the story
short, Salazar and Blanco concluded to act together. <i>El Quincenal Josefino</i>,
no. 32, in <i>Star and Herald</i>, Dec. 24, 26, 1868. The editor of this publication
was Lorenzo Montúfar. Whatever may be asserted against Castro, he had
proved himself a liberal, enlightened, and upright ruler. His administration
had given conclusive proof that the president valued liberty of the press and
speech as necessary to the existence of a republican government. The country
had been enjoying those privileges, and prospering as it had never done
before. <i>U. S. Minister J. B. Blair, to Sec. Fish</i>, June 23, 1873.

R.</i>, <i>Col. Ley.</i>, xxiv. 62. Guardia's administration during the past six years
was highly extolled in the <i>Gaceta Oficial</i> of San José. It said that his surrender
of power proved the falsity of the charge that he had intended holding it
for life. We shall see how much this statement was worth. It claimed for
him that he had at all times blended leniency with firmness, which facts fail
to establish. He was equally credited with increasing the revenues by his
successful measures to repress smuggling; with protecting industry and labor;
endeavoring to provide the country with a railroad between the two oceans;
improving the morale of the country; spreading public education; promoting
political and commercial relations with other countries; forwarding public
works; and lastly, vigorously defending Costa Rica's rights against Nicaragua's
pretensions. <i>Salv.</i>, <i>Gaceta Ofic.</i>, May 22, 1876. On the other hand, we
are told that Costa Rica's revenues were squandered in keeping 2,000 men on
the frontier as a menace to Nicaragua. <i>Pan. Star and Herald</i>, June 1, 1876.
Guardia has been justly called a tyrant, because of his arbitrary acts and violations
of the constitution. Electoral and parliamentary freedom, under his
rule, was a farce; results at elections being what his will dictated, and congress
being mostly made up of his immediate friends and a number of puppets.
There were some honorable exceptions, like that of Zacarías García, who, for
acting as a real representative of the people, was imprisoned without protest
on the part of his colleagues. The independence of the three powers, personal
rights, freedom of the press, and other constitutional guaranties, were
repeatedly trampled upon by Guardia, by his favorite, Pedro Quiroz, and by
other satellites. Justices of the supreme court and numerous other prominent
citizens were either imprisoned, banished, or mulcted in heavy sums of
money, without any form of trial having preceded. José M. Castro, chief
justice, and Salvador Jimenez, justice of the supreme court, were by Guardia's
autocratic command made to live for a time on the Pacific coast. Even his
brother, Victor Guardia, was harshly treated for showing an independent
spirit; and his brother-in-law, Leon Fernandez, was several months kept in
irons for some mysterious offence that was never brought to trial, and afterward
transferred to a horrible dungeon in Limon, where he was cruelly treated
until he succeeded in effecting his escape. Other infringements of the laws
are also mentioned, and not a few cases of brutality, even the use of the lash
on respectable citizens, which Guardia and his myrmidons were challenged to
contradict to the face of Costa Ricans. <i>Aguirre, J. M.</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Recortes ... Corresp.

1876, and addressed to Francisco Chavez C., editor of <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">El Costaricense</span></i>, Guardia's
press organ, whom he handles without gloves for his defence of Guardia's
acts and abuse of Guardia's opponents. The writer had been one of the victims
of both, and was evidently well posted on the history of Guardia's rule.
Making allowance for exaggeration in some instances, the conclusion to be
arrived at is that Guardia acted like an autocrat who would brook no opposition.
It does not appear, however, that he was sanguinary.

of Salvador of Gen. Florencio Xatruch, the priest Miguel Bustillo, and José
Manuel Selva, Hondurans; and also of certain Nicaraguans, who after their
rebellion against the government of Fernando Guzman in their own country,
had found a refuge in Salvador, and made common cause with the enemies
of President Medina, because he had supported Guzman with the moral and
diplomatic influence of his government. The Salvadoran negotiator denied
that Xatruch was a political refugee. He was sent by Nic. in 1863 to Salv.
at the head of an auxiliary force. Later with Nicaragua's permission he was
employed by Salv., he being since 1858 a general of division of her army, a
rank conferred on him for his services against Walker and his filibusters; and
was therefore entitled to all the rights of a Salvadoran citizen. Salv. pledged,
however, that he would do no hostile act against Hond. As to adopting any
action against the Nicaraguans, the demand could not be acceded to, because
they did not come under the provisions of the treaty with Honduras, nor
were they political refugees at all. The commissioner of Salv. made counter-charges:
1st. Hond. had violated art. 9 of the treaty of Santa Rosa, in that
her legislature had empowered the executive to declare war against Salv.
without first complying with the terms of that clause. 2d. She had allowed
asylum to Salvadoran refugees, giving them employment on the frontier of
Salv., where they had been constantly plotting and uttering menaces against
their govt, using arms obtained from Honduran govt warehouses. All remonstrances
against such proceedings had been disregarded. 3d. Hond.,
heeding false reports, had raised 1,500 men, keeping a portion on the Salv.
frontier, and maintaining a warlike attitude. The Honduran commissioners
denied the correctness of the charges, and quoted instances in which their
government had given proofs of deference and friendship toward its neighbor.

and abundant resources of every kind. They had but few desertions, whereas
from the Salv. ranks there had been many. Barrios' army on entering Santa
Ana exceeded 9,000 men. Salv. still had a chance of obtaining honorable

to the chances of a battle. <i>Gonzalez</i>, <i>Rel. de los Hechos Ocurr.</i>, 1-18, in <i>Pap.

1st. Presid. Valle was to resign the executive office to the person hereafter
named. 2d. Gen. Gonzalez to give up the command of the forces to Valle.
Both were to have full guaranties for their persons and property. 3d. The
Salv. forces now at Santa Ana were to retire to San Salv.; Santa Ana to be
evacuated by 12 M. of the 27th inst. War material that could not be removed
in time was to be delivered to Uraga under inventory. 4th. Santa Ana, and
territory within two leagues of the town, were to be occupied by the Guatemalans,
the civil authorities being allowed to exercise their functions therein,
but expected to furnish supplies; Barrios guaranteeing security of persons and
property to the inhabitants. The Guat. forces in the east were to occupy
San Miguel, and territory within one league, under the same guaranties
allowed the civil authorities and people of Santa Ana. 5th. Presid. Valle
was to convoke a junta of notables, within four days from the ratification of
this convention, to meet at Santa Ana, and choose in accord with Barrios the
person in whose hands Valle must resign his offices. 6th. The acting executive
must, within ten days, convoke the people of Salv. to freely choose, a
month later, the president of the republic. 7th. The person designated by
the notables shall have organized his government and issued the convocation,
the forces of Guat. will leave the Salv. territory. 8th. Barrios and the provisional
executive of Salv. will make a treaty of peace between the two
republics. 9th. This convention must be ratified by Barrios at once, and by
telegram within twenty-four hours by Valle, the ratifications to be exchanged
within six hours after. An additional article made free the transit between
the two countries. The convention was duly ratified. Upwards of 200 persons
at Santa Ana sent Barrios, after the occupation of the town by his troops,
April 30th, an address of thanks for his magnanimity and generosity, adding
that no Salvadoran could justly complain of the behavior of the Guat. army.

the Salv. stronghold, Casa Blanca. Barrios at 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> of the 2d led the
assault on the N. E. side of the fortification with the Jiron brigade of Jalapas,
which on that day behaved cowardly. Shortly after the assault, a little
past 9, Barrios was mortally wounded, and forthwith removed. The Jalapas
gave way, divulging to other troops the death of the president. Thus it came
to pass that the first who saw Barrios fall were the first to take to flight, followed
by men of several other brigades. To avert a disaster, the troops operating
on the N. side were recalled. The firing ceased on both sides at 4:30,
and the retreat to the Magdalena began at 6:30, the Salvadorans not pursuing.
The same authority claimed that if the firing had been kept up an
hour longer, the Guatemalans would have won the day, several bodies of
troops having abandoned the town, and the supply of ammunition in the
place being already scanty. He asserts that the Guat. loss in all the fights
was in killed, besides the president, and his son Gen. Venancio Barrios, colonels

its troops, when he quietly slipped into Palencia, a town distant 8 or 9 miles
from Guatemala, in the night of Saturday. Feeling certain that the govt
was ignorant of his whereabouts, and confident that the people of Palencia
were friendly, he failed to adopt proper precautions, and even had high mass
chanted for his troops in the small hours of the morning. But it so happened
that the authorities of Guatemala received late in the night information of
his arrival, and of the number of his men. An overwhelming force of Santa
Rosa Indians, devoted to Cerna and hostile to Cruz' Indians, was despatched
under command of Brig. Solares, who surrounded Cruz and attacked him before
he had begun to prepare for his own attack of the capital. He made a
desperate fight of two hours, however, behind the adobe walls of a corral, but
it availed naught. His only chance of escape was in flight. A rush carried
him and his remaining men to the edge of a ravine, and he had gone down
half of the steep descent when a ball struck him in the thigh and broke it.
No quarter was asked or given. He was slain while fiercely fighting to the
last. His fleeing men were relentlessly pursued for several days, and such
as were not killed in the ravines were captured and executed. <i>Peatfield's

and cruel acts in violation of the constitution and other laws; that it
had usurped powers, and had assailed the representatives of the people; it
had ruined the public treasury, and compromised the independence of the
country by contracting without authority of law a ruinous loan in Europe.
Consequently, the people would no longer forbear with its tyrannical domination,
and had resolved to set it aside. The following are the resolutions
epitomized: 1st. To depose the tyrant and usurper Cerna; 2d. To appoint
Miguel García Granados provisional president with full authority to reorganize
a government on the bases proclaimed by him May 8, 1871; 3d. He was
also instructed when expedient to convoke a constituent assembly for framing
a new fundamental law; 4th. The officers solemnly bound themselves not
to lay down their arms until these purposes were effected. Signed by Gen.

rule of thirty years. A large number of jesuits, well fed on the
sweat of the people, and their acolytes and choristers; another large quantity
of Capuchin friars who preyed on the inhabitants of Antigua, Guat.; about
200 friars and lay brothers in the capital, most of them lazy and stupid;
nearly 200 useless nuns, of whom some 40 were in a state of insanity or
idiocy, and in condition to be canonized; one archbishop, 2 bishops, 12 or
15 vicars and canons, and a high steward of church property, etc; a foreign
debt of five million dollars; a nearly complete absence of public education,
necessitating the establishment of at least 500 schools and colleges adequately
supplied; few, if any, roads or bridges; no steam vessels; no adequate postal
service; no telegraphs; no public lands, for immense tracts of unproductive
lands were held by the church and by a few aristocrats. <i>Juan Álvarez</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Dos

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XX-30'>[XX-30]</a></span> An unfortunate circumstance occurred. A portion of the troops with

faithful to him, and begged he should lead them to the field in defence of his
cause; but he knew any such effort must end in disaster, and refused. He
then continued his flight to Honduras. Most of his ministers also escaped.
Indeed, no effort was made to detain them, or other men of the fallen administration,
it being considered a better policy not to be hampered with the responsibility
of disposing of them. The old minister of war remained behind and
was not molested. Full particulars on the campaign are given in <i>Salv.</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">El

the treasury was empty. There was danger to be apprehended from the radical
element among the liberals, composed of a large portion of the mechanics
and artisans, who claimed that the change had mainly resulted from their
influence, and they now wished to dictate measures which the new government
could not decree. Their violent feeling was manifested specially toward
the jesuits and other religious orders. Their discussions in the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">club de los
artesanos</span>, and elsewhere, often disclosed a marked suspicion of and conveyed
warnings to the authorities. There were also misgivings about Barrios' intentions.
Indeed, many believed that though not actually at the head of
affairs, he had the control; even after leaving the city, he was supposed to
aspire to the presidency, to which he would have himself elected as soon as
the constituent assembly should meet. Meantime, it was said, he would
allow García Granados to put the disrupted state in order, and enact the
needed measures.

assembly Nov. 5th, authorized their permanent reëstablishment, revoking all
other laws or decrees to the contrary, notably one of 1845, notwithstanding
the many protests made against the measure. The most plausible pretext for
the restoration of the jesuits had been the alleged scarcity of competent priests
for the work of spreading the gospel; which was equivalent to saying that
the 300 priests living in the republic were both insufficient and incapable.
The real object of the hasty reintroduction of the order was said to be the
aggrandizement of the house of Canon Juan José Aycinena, closely connected
by family ties with Manuel F. Pavon and Luis Batres. Aycinena had pledged
himself to bring the order in, and in exchange for this service it was to influence
his appointment as archbishop of Guatemala. It was a well-understood
bargain. <i>Guat.</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Carta al Ilmo. Sr. Arzob. por un Catól. Apostól. romano</span></i>, Guat.,

capuchins were natives of Spain, most of whom had been partisans of the pretender

bethlehemites, when they were taken by a military guard to the coast and
shipped away, with orders never to return. They had made themselves particularly

Ley.</i>, <i>Gob. Democ.</i>, i. 155. During this tenure Barrios called for a forced loan.
On the 15th he summoned to his presence at the comandancia general a number
of citizens, one of whom imprudently said that he would go armed to punish
any insult. Barrios accused them of hostility to the government, and of rendering
pecuniary assistance to the insurgents. He warned them of their danger,
and suggested the expediency of their aiding the govt to bring the insurrection
to an end. It is said that the armed one, Rafael Batres, a son of the
late minister of state, two or three times laughed in a contemptuous manner,
enraging Barrios, who walked up to him, tore open his coat, and pulled out
of it a revolver, upbraiding him as a coward and would-be murderer; then
ordered that 100 blows should be inflicted on his back with a supple stick or
rod, such as was used to punish private soldiers. Batres received his punishment,
and was afterward sent to jail. The other men were also confined in
the common jail, and the next morning were brought with shackles on through
the streets to the comandancia, and told that they would not be released till
they signed bonds to pay their respective shares of the forced loan; after
doing which they were set at liberty. Julian Volio, ex-minister of Costa R.
and Guat., did not receive any ill treatment, but was made to leave the country.
Batres was also banished. Referring to this incident in a message to
congress, he said that the rebellion had been instigated with the pretext that
religion was menaced. His measures he confessed had been severe, but
necessary. The result realized his expectations, for as soon as these men
ceased furnishing resources to the rebellion it collapsed. <i>Barrios</i>, <i>Mensaje</i>,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-3'>[XXI-3]</a></span> I will quote in corroboration what foreign correspondents said. Barrios'
administration in 1875 was enjoying the confidence of the people, and had the
support of public opinion. He had in his favor not only the testimony of the
liberal portion of the Cent. Am. press, but of intelligent travellers just from
the theatre of his so-called atrocities against the liberty of his people. He had
more: the direct as well as tacit testimony of the property holders, both native
and foreign. The guiding principle of Barrios' govt was to check evil
practices, and to encourage good deeds. Again in 1880 Barrios continued as
indefatigable as ever, travelling over the country, devising measures for the
benefit of his fellow-citizens. The country was at peace. Foreigners, in
comparing Dec. 1870 with Dec. 1880, can scarcely realize that they are living
in the same country, and that only one decade has elapsed since the terrors of
1870. Since then Guat. has seen progress in every respect, and all due to the
energy of this man, who has not wavered in his efforts to educate his fellow-citizens
to the standard of the times. <i>Pan. Star and Herald</i>, Jan. 12, 14, 1875;

for the education of officers at the expense of the state; alumni were
also admitted at their own charge, who were not bound to accept commissions
in the army; the Normal, for the training of teachers; and the Belen, for the
instruction of females. All those schools were in charge of teachers from the

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXI-6'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-6'>[XXI-6]</a></span> Espionage existed. Domestic servants even were used as spies. The
postal service was like an office of the old inquisition. These charges are
probably true, and the system, one of long standing, may have been demanded
by the political situation. It has been said that he had a young Spanish
priest named Félix Pagés murdered in cold blood. The other side of the
story is that Pagés shot at him Sept. 14, 1877, in San Pedro Jocopilas, missed
him, a scuffle ensued for the possession of the weapon, when other persons
entered the room, one of whom was Barrios' body-servant, Inés Cruz, who
seeing Pagés again trying to discharge the revolver at his master, drew out
his own weapon, and shot the priest dead. This version is the official one,
and was communicated by U. S. Minister Williamson to his government. <i>U. S.
Gov. Doc.</i>, H. Ex. Doc., 45th Cong., 3d Sess., i. pt 1, 73-4; <i>Star and Herald</i>,

jail, and afterward banished to distant towns. <i>Un Guatemalteco</i>, <i>Cartas</i>, 24. I
have no space for the innumerable accusations of anonymous and irresponsible
persons. The following are given because made by a prominent Mexican
general who served some time under Barrios: Innocent men of respectable
position were whipped by his order, and women confined in the common jail.
A judge was set to sowing grass. A distinguished lawyer was made to march
in a religious procession through the streets dressed as a private soldier. An
ecclesiastic, for failing to salute him, was kept for hours opposite his balcony
with head uncovered and erect, and treated with contumely. He had the
head of a city councilman shaved like a priest's, and then shut him up in a
convent. It was Barrios' practice to have men beaten till they told what he
wanted of them, and he invented a cruel torture called el apreton, which was
compressing the person's temples. His assassinations were wanton and cold-blooded.
This general, however, was a considerable time in Barrios' service,
and had a falling out with him. His statements may be the result of spite.
As a ruler who had in his hands during nearly 12 years the destinies of his
country, he undoubtedly committed many errors, and as a man he had defects;
but how deny, speaking with truth, the benefits his abilities, patriotism,
constancy, and energy bestowed? <i>Uraga, J. L.</i>, <i>Réplica á J. R. Barrios</i>, 6-7,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-26'>[XXI-26]</a></span> With the evidence obtained during the day and night of the 1st, several
persons said to be implicated were arrested, and the judicial investigation was
initiated. The plan of the sedition was ascertained from the acknowledgments
and confessions of its promoters and others. The priest, Gabriel Aguilar,
José Lara Pavon, Enrique Guzman, and others, as appeared in the testimony,
had organized themselves as a society, recognizing one another by means of
signs, to promote a revolt. The execution of their plan was left to A. Kopeski,
commander of the artillery, and his second, Capt. Leon de Rodas, at
whose quarters assembled in the night of the 1st a number of men who were
then armed, to be ready for relieving the guards at the palace and comandancia
general, after they had been narcotized with wine and morphine furnished
by Aguilar. This part of the plot once accomplished, the commanders of
other bodies of troops were to receive forged orders to bring their men, without
arms, into the city, when others in the conspiracy stationed outside would
seize the arms. One of these orders, ostensibly signed by Barrios, was sent
Oct. 31st to the comandante at Palencia, who, not doubting its genuineness,
was on the point of obeying it; but despatched an officer to inquire where he
was to station his men, and the object of the call. The president at once
telegraphed to other commanders, and was advised that they had similar
orders. One man was arrested, and then another, until the plot was unravelled.
A large portion of the criminal element, as well as of the lower classes,
were mixed up in the affair. The president, his family, ministers, and friends
were to be assassinated. Rich men would have to ransom their lives with
sums ranging from $50,000 down to $10,000. Daggers, gags, and morphine
were discovered. Barrios decreed, Nov. 5th, that the parties should be tried
by court-martial. This decree was countersigned by all his ministers; namely,
J. Barberena, José Ant. Salazar, Lorenzo Montúfar, and under sec. of war
A. Ubico, then in charge of the portfolio. Foreigners as well as natives realized
their narrow escape from a fearful catastrophe, and commended Barrios
and his ministers for their action. The justice of the sentences was fully
acknowledged. Barrios, in his message to the constituent assembly, in
March 1879, alluding to the affair, said: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">La sociedad guatemalteca se vió

of the unsettled condition of the country, though well aware that unrestricted
powers are incompatible with republican principles. The election of
deputies was to begin Jan. 10th, and all citizens were made eligible, excepting
only such as held certain offices, as jefes políticos, revenue officials, judges,

the government to settle it by treaties, which was equivalent to nullifying
the clause. There were exceptions also to the 14th, intended to set
down as a principle that neither citizens nor foreigners were entitled to indemnity
for damages accruing to them during civil wars from the acts of
revolutionary factions. The right of Guat. to insert in her fundamental law
every principle or rule she might deem proper for her internal administration
was fully recognized; but as regarded those dependent for their sanction on
the consent of nations, in their intercourse with one another, the representatives
reserved their respective country's rights. <i>Mex.</i>, <i>Correspond. Dipl.</i>, ii.

since 1840, Guat. had been under a dictatorship, or under institutions which
greatly curtailed the political rights of the ruled.

free institutions he had contributed to establish on a firm basis as he hoped;
without neglecting, however, the duty he owed at all times to his country,
and to those who, like himself, shed their blood in their efforts to the same
end. He would be ever found ready to support the liberal government, and
hoped that no credence would be given to the slander that he desired to leave
the country, and thus shirk responsibility. This charge was made when he
left for the U. S. to settle the boundary question with Mexico. <i>Barrios</i>, <i>Mensaje</i>,

had been to promote the general weal, and not his personal aggrandizement.

of war; Fernando Cruz, of foreign affairs; Francisco Lainfiesta, of fomento;
Delfino Sanchez, of treasury and pub. credit; Cayetano Diaz Mérida, of govt
and justice; and Ramon Murga, of pub. instruction. The following is a
synopsis of the decree. Art. 1. The ruler of the rep. of Guat. proclaims the
union of Cent. Am.; to which end he assumes the rôle of supreme military
chief with absolute control. Art. 2. He will accept the coöperation of such
govts, communities, and rulers, as, within the terms laid down, should acquiesce
and make common cause with them. Art. 3. A gen. assembly of 15
members from each state, freely chosen by popular suffrage, should meet at
Guatemala May 1st to enact the political constitution of Cent. Am., and establish
the manner, time, and form of choosing the president, his official term,
date upon which he was to receive the executive authority from the assembly,
and the place where the supreme federal authorities were to reside. Art. 4.
Any person attempting by word or deed to oppose this decree would be
dealt with as a traitor to the cause of Cent. Am. Art. 5. The people of Cent.
Am. are urged to aid the accomplishment of this project. Art. 6. Suitable
rewards offered to officers of army and militia efficaciously aiding. Art. 7.
Rewards also offered to the rank and file. Art. 8. Establishes the flag of the
rep.: three vertical stripes, the middle one white, the other two blue; the
white stripe exhibiting the coat of arms, a quetzal perched upon a column,
with the following inscription: 'Libertad y Union—15 de Setiembre de 1821-28
de Febrero de 1885.' Art. 9. No negotiations relating to territory, international
treaties, foreign or national loans, or other stipulations of analogous
nature or importance, entered into by the other states of Cent. Am. after the
date of this decree, would be recognized. Art. 10. The minister of foreign
affairs was directed to lay this decree before the assembly of Guat., the other
govern. of Cent. Am., and all powers of Am. and Europe with which Guat.
had relations of friendship and trade. <i>La Estrella de Pan.</i>, March 28, 1885;

<i>S. F. Call</i>, March 13, 1885. It will be well to mention here the reasons
which prompted the legislative assembly to proclaim the unity of Cent. Am.
in the manner adopted by Barrios: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">El inmenso prestigio de que gozaba aquel
memorable jefe, el civismo de que siempre habia dado inequívocas muestras,
y los muchos elementos de que disponia para hacer práctico aquel pensamiento,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXI-51'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-51'>[XXI-51]</a></span> Zaldívar then, as well as afterward, denied having betrayed Barrios.
The circular of Feb. 24, 1883, to the liberal party, was issued by the latter
after a conference with the former at Asuncion Mita. In that famous manifesto,
Barrios pledged his honor not to attempt effecting the unification, except
by peaceful means, and with the concurrence of the five republics. His
message to the Guat. assembly in 1884 indicated that violent means were
out of the question. A correspondent of a Panamá paper, who seemed to
have personal knowledge of the negotiations, both public and confidential,
assures us that at every interview between the two rulers the Salvadoran had
opposed without ambiguity all propositions, open or implied, to employ force;
and that Barrios had every time admitted the weight of the reasons adduced
by him. Indeed, only 20 days before his attempted assumption of supreme
command over Cent. Am. Barrios assured of Salvadoran minister of foreign
affairs, Gallegos, who had gone to Guat. upon a confidential mission from
Zaldívar, of his conviction that never had the plan of reconstructing Cent. Am.
by compulsion been so unpropitious and dangerous as at the present time;
adding these words: '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Poner hoy la mano en este asunto equivaldría á meterla
en un avispero.</span>' <i>La Estella de Pan.</i>, May 9, 1885; <i>S. F. Chronicle</i>, June 5,

These words would seem to imply that there had been an understanding between
the two, and treachery was suspected.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXI-53'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-53'>[XXI-53]</a></span> Menendez, calling himself a soldier of the union, had urged all Central
Americans to aid Barrios. Zaldívar on March 15th promulgated an act of
the Salv. congress declaring Menendez a traitor to his country. This decree
was in force only a short time.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXI-54'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXI-54'>[XXI-54]</a></span> Melchor Ordoñez, Spanish minister accredited to both republics, had in
a telegram assured him that Zaldívar was his sincere friend, but was in a
difficult position, having to act in accord with public opinion. He should
bear in mind the Salvadorans had been led to believe that he, Barrios, intended
to deprive them of their nationality to gratify his own ambition.

for Salv. It was to be in force until Barrios should be overthrown,
and another govt established entirely disconnected with him and offering
guaranties of peace for Cent. Am., after which the issue of Cent. Am. union
might be considered by the parties in a proper spirit, and at an opportune
occasion. Costa R. pledged herself to furnish 3,000 men at her own cost,
but if only 1,000 were called for, she would contribute also $100,000, and
1,000 Remington rifles with 500 cartridges for each. Nic. agreed to furnish
4,000 troops also at her own cost. Salv. would contribute her whole available
military force. The command-in-chief was vested first in the president
of Salv., next in that of Nic., and third in that of Costa R., or of such persons
as one or the other might designate. Costa R., however, supplied 2,000
men, and offered to loan money to Salv. <i>Costa R.</i>, <i>Informe Sec. Rel. Exter.</i>,

revoked, and Barrios being dead, the causes which placed Guat. at war with
Salv., Nic., and Costa R. had ceased to exist; 2d. It was a patriotic duty to
promote feelings of fraternity and concord; 3. That the governments of the
republics of Cent. Am. were prompted by the same sentiments, and those of
Salv., Nic., and Costa R. had already made peace with Hond., which had
seconded the movement of the late president of Guat.; 4. That through the
friendly mediation of the foreign corps an understanding with Salv. had

thus: 'The presidential term shall be of four years, commencing on the 1st of

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXII-7'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXII-7'>[XXII-7]</a></span> I will, however, repeat here in a few words the causes alleged by Hond.
Salvador had violated the treaty of Santa Rosa of March 25, 1862, in refusing
to surrender the perpetrators of two atrocious murders. She had abetted the
refugees who, in the last six years, had been fanning the flame of discord in
Hond.; had refused to heed the remonstrances of the latter; and on the contrary,
had placed a force on the frontier, and generally assumed a hostile
attitude.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXII-8'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXII-8'>[XXII-8]</a></span> The guaranty was given as a consideration for certain advantages, which
could not accrue till after the road was finished. The Am. gov. could not
therefore be required to repel an invasion of the route from abroad. The
correspondence between ministers Baxter and Torbert with the govts of
Hond. and Salv., and with their own, appears in <i>U. S. Govt Doc.</i>, H. Ex. Doc.,

proceeded to Trujillo, which was surrendered June 9th. That part of the
plan failed, and the expedition then went to Puerto Cortés. The invaders
had an understanding with Betancourt, the officer in command at Omoa, who
toward the end of June rebelled with the garrison of 150 men; but he was
attacked and defeated by Streber, of Arias' govt. It was during this trouble
that Streber's troops pillaged, in July, the mercantile houses of Omoa, foreign
as well as native, which culminated in the bombardment afterward of the
port by a British man-of-war, of which I gave the details elsewhere. The
house of the Am. consul having been likewise invaded, the government had

Comayagua, in the presence of their representative, troops, the ministers of

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXIII-5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXIII-5'>[XXIII-5]</a></span> The grounds alleged by the insurgents were: 1st. Violation by Guzman
of the pledges given at his inauguration. It was said that as he had detached
himself from the party which raised him to the presidential chair, and on the
other hand, had not shown any predilection for the old conservatives, who
had tried to surround him, the true liberals had reposed faith in him, but he
had not realized their expectations. Jerez and his associates, on their return
from Costa Rica, had awaited an invitation to effect a fusion of parties, in
order that the people should see the govt pursuing a liberal and generous
policy. Jerez' advances had been coldly, and even disdainfully, met. Hence
his letter to Guzman of June 26th, telling him that while he had pretended
sympathy for the liberal cause, its friends had never seen any tangible proof
of it. '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Muchas veces V. ha manifestado simpatías por las causas liberales;
pero no las hemos visto eficaces.</span>' Other charges were: usurpation of powers,
inefficiency, illegal expenditures of public moneys, nepotism, encouragement
to smugglers, etc. At a subsequent date, after his arms had proved
victorious, Guzman denied that he had done any of the things imputed to
him, proudly asserting that no government had in these latter days respected
the rights of all citizens as his administration had done, and he challenged
one and all to bring forward proofs that he had before the revolution broke
out deprived any citizen of his life, liberty, or property. Faults may have
been committed by the govt, but it was folly to deny that republicanism had
not become a reality under it. The knowledge of this by the people confined
the revolution within narrow bounds, and gave victory to Guzman; and it
was by his generosity that the promoters of the rebellion escaped the consequences
of their ill-advised step.

of the alliance, had conceived a vast plan for the conquest of the Spanish
American countries, which till within a few years had been under the catholic
king's domination. Many eminent men in Europe and the U. S. approved the
idea of the American congress, and bestowed high encomiums on its author.
Abbé de Pradt championed it in his work, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Congrés de Panamá</span></i>, saying: 'The
congress of Panamá will be one of the greatest events of our times, and
its effects will be felt to the remotest posterity.' <i>Pradt</i>, <i>Cong. de Pan.</i> (Sp.

good advice, assuring the Sp. Am. plenipotentiaries that his government
would assuredly mediate with Spain; meantime they should avoid all cause
of offence to European powers. Col Van Veer, the gentleman from Holland,
held no public capacity; his mission was a private one, confined to the expression
of his sovereign's warm wishes for the happiness of the American republics.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXV-42'>[XXV-42]</a></span> It must be confessed that the impression caused by the influx of foreigners,
parading the streets, many of them armed with bowie-knives and revolvers,
often incited by intoxication and gambling to acts of lawlessness, was not
a favorable one. They often appeared to the natives as lawless invaders.
The laws were not framed for the emergency, and the authorities were powerless
to stop the scandals occurring every day in the streets. Robberies and
other crimes among the foreigners themselves were common. Gambling-houses,
in violation of law, were publicly kept, exhibiting strange signs, such
as Card Room, Owls' Club, etc. Once a crowd of Americans fell upon the
small guard of the jail, disarmed it, and set free some of their countrymen.
<i>Maldonado</i>, <i>Asuntos Polít. Pan.</i>, MS., 2, 5-6. A writer relates that he saw
ruffians in 1850 throw filth on religious processions. Once an American
rode a mule into the cathedral, and tried to make it drink from the baptismal
font. Fortunately Theller, an American resident, interfered. 'Often the
dirty red-shirted fellows would stride into the chapels and light their cigars
at the altar.' <i>Cal. Chronicle</i>, May 20, 1856.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXV-43'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXV-43'>[XXV-43]</a></span> The trouble originated in the act of a drunken man named Jack Oliver,
who seized a slice of watermelon from a fruit stall, and refused to pay for it.
Simultaneously and without preconcertion, fights occurred between parties of
passengers and the colored population in various parts of the town. The city
was soon in commotion. Residents retired to their homes and barred themselves
in. The fights lasted about three hours, when the foreigners were
driven into the depot. The negroes, who had formerly been humble and
submissive to the whites, remembered on that day the abusive treatment
often received by them at the hands of transient foreigners; but did not confine
their expressions of hatred to foreigners only, for they transversed the streets
crying, <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Mueran los blancos</span>! They were now ungovernable. They rushed
to the Panamá depot—at a moment when from 250 to 300 passengers of both
sexes and all ages, landed at Colon from the steamship <i>Illinois</i>, were procuring
their tickets for San Francisco—and began firing at the building, hitting one
man. The doors were then closed, and some of the passengers armed themselves.
It has been stated by eye-witnesses that some of the armed passengers
went out and discharged their arms at the black mob before any shot had
been fired at the building; but the weight of testimony is against this assertion.
U. S. Consul Ward came on horseback, saying that the government at
his request would soon send a force to quell the disturbance. The force did
come, but instead of affording protection to the passengers huddled in the
depot, fired a volley of musketry in their midst, and followed it by others, besides
stray shots. The only reasons assigned for this conduct of the force
were that it sympathized with the mob, or was awed by it. The latter was
the real cause. The active firing from the outside continued about one and a
half hours even after it had ceased from the inside. The mob for a time
did not succeed in entering the building, but finally broke into the baggage-room,
killing and wounding several persons. Fortunately, the rabble was
bent more on plunder than slaughter. It is said that even the wounded had
their boots pulled from their feet and carried away. Many robberies had
also been committed by the negroes in the city, principally in shops and barrooms.

Fábrega's government responsible, and claimed damages. They also demanded
protection for the passengers and treasure then expected from California
on the <i>Golden Gate</i>. Fábrega, upon the latter point, gave the required
assurances, recommending that the railroad officials should also adopt precautionary
measures. In his report to the supreme government on the 22d
of April, 1856, he denied the charges preferred against him by Totten and
Ward, declaring that the whole affair had been sudden and unpremeditated;
and he, as well as the gens d'armes had the best intentions to protect the passengers,
and the firing upon them had been unauthorized, though resulting
from the fact that the passengers had continued shooting. He kept to himself,
however, that fear for the lives of himself and the few other white people
of the city, which were in great peril from the infuriated blacks, had
deterred him from attacking the mob. The latter was calmed and dispersed
only through the good offices, called for by Fábrega, of the influential men
among the negro population. <i>Pan.</i>, <i>Gaceta del Est.</i>, Apr. 26, May 3, 10, 27,

of all nations in the execution of the neutrality treaty of 1846, feared to become
involved in the revolutionary strife going on in Nueva Granada, besides
incurring danger of misrepresentation by other powers if it should act without
consulting them. The 35th art. of the treaty of December 12, 1846, says:
'And in order to secure to themselves the tranquil and constant enjoyment
of these advantages, and as an especial compensation for said advantages, and
for the favors they have acquired by the 4th, 5th, and 6th art. of this treaty,
the U. S. guarantee positively and efficaciously to N. Granada, by the present
stipulation, the perfect neutrality of the before-mentioned Isthmus, with the
view that the free transit from the one to the other sea may not be interrupted
or embarrassed in any future time while this treaty exists; and in
consequence, the U. S. also guarantee in the same manner the rights of sovereignty
and property which N. Granada has and possesses over the said territory.'
Sec. Seward laid the request of Gen. Herran before the British
and French governments to ascertain their views. Earl Russell thought
there was no occasion as yet for armed intervention. Should it occur, his

in the country. He has been accused of scandalous corruption and
connivance at robbery. However, he seems to have confined his peculation
to the public revenue, a practice which was not new since Guardia's fall.
Some time after, Calancha together with Gabriel Neira invaded the state with
a force from Cauca; but while crossing the river Santa María in the hacienda
Las Cruces, they were met by the government troops under Col Vicente
Olarte, and routed with the loss of many killed, wounded, and prisoners,
Neira being one of the latter. Calancha was again defeated at San Francisco
near Natá, and delivered by his men to the victors. His brother Francisco was
also taken. It is recorded that Mrs Jane White Ball, an American, together
with other women, provided a hospital and nursed the wounded of both
bands. <i>Pan.</i>, <i>Boletin Ofic.</i>, Apr. 22, June 7, Sept. 18, Oct. 10, 1865; <i>Correoso's

positions filled under the national government. He has been accused, however,
of immoral practices. His administration was peaceable, but left evils
that were never eradicated. He inaugurated the corrupt system of extorting
contributions from political opponents, whereby, as the latter averred, he
materially improved his own financial condition, though he had decreed himself
only the modest salary of $200 per month. <i>Pan.</i>, <i>Boletin Ofic.</i>, Apr. 1,
1865. Every citizen who had a competency was made to contribute. One
day he had all the respectable citizens arrested to extort money, for which he
never accounted. The majority of the public employés had to sell their salary
warrants for one half or one fourth of their value. The country derived
no other fruit from his administration than poverty.

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVI-13'>[XXVI-13]</a></span> It must be borne in mind that whatever the words liberal and conservador
may mean in other Spanish American countries, in Panamá the former
has been appropriated by the colored portion of the inhabitants, who have
been joined by a few whites for their own political and pecuniary aims. The
conservador party was made up mostly of white men and property holders,
and they have often been victimized by the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">gamonales</span>, or leaders of the other
party, whenever the latter has been in power.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXVI-14'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVI-14'>[XXVI-14]</a></span> The circumstances connected with the sickness and death of Gen. Olarte
and Manuel M. Morro afford presumptive evidence of foul play. After a banquet
in San Miguel, on the last day Olarte was to be there, wine prepared
with fish poison was served him and his secretary, José M. Bermudez. The
latter, by accident, escaped the fate prepared for him, and Morro, being invited
by Olarte to join him, partook of the wine. Olarte, having his stomach
full of food and wine, immediately threw up all. Morro, on feeling the effects,
took two doses of ipecacuanha, and succeeded in vomiting. But neither
victim saved himself. Both were taken to Panamá, where Olarte died in
five days, and Morro in about eleven. The facts have been strenuously
denied. Correoso, <i>Statem.</i>, MS., 5, asserts that Olarte contracted a fever in
his visit to Darien. The first diagnosis of the physicians, it is understood,
was that the patients were suffering from yellow fever, or some other malignant
disease. Morro was a talented young man belonging to one of the
prominent families of the city, and much liked by all.

affairs of the Isthmus, the following charges preferred by M. J. Perez from
Panamá in a letter of Oct. 22, 1884, to Aníbal Galindo, are worthy of notice:
1st. Public intervention of the general government in internal affairs of the
state; 2d. Barefaced protection by the gen. govt to rebels in arms against the
constitutional govt of the state; 3d. Intimate alliance of the federal force with
the opposing conservatives and with the radicals to disarm the government,
and exercise pressure on the assembly, forcibly hindering its performance of
constitutional functions; 4th. Consequences of the foregoing course; acts of
piracy on the part of the rebels, violence, bloodshed, international claims,
humiliation. <i>Pan. Cronista</i>, Oct. 25, 1884. Correoso corroborates all this in

in this pamphlet purposes, as he assures us, to point out the source of the
almost continuous disturbances that have occurred on the Isthmus since
1860, laying particular stress on the events from 1880 to 1885. It might be
expecting too much that he should express an impartial and wholly unwarped
judgment on those events, and on his political opponents. It must
be acknowledged, however, that his statements appear to be fair enough,
and that his assumption of responsibility for some of the acts which he censures
is frank. <i>Simon Maldonado</i>, <i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Asuntos Políticos de Panamá</span></i>, MS., 42 pp.

and running due north-west and south-east, beginning with the Cartago or
Irazú, in Costa Rica, which is 11,480 ft high, and has left traces of violent
eruptions before the historic period; the only proof of its present activity
being a small rill of smoke visible from the foot of the mountain. There are
hundreds of other volcanic peaks and extinct craters on the line, the most
notable being the Turrialba, which was in active eruption in 1866, the ashy
matter from it having been beneficial to the coffee plantations; Chirripó,
Blanco, Závalo, Barba, Los Votos 9,840 ft high, also in Costa R. Abogado,
Cerro Pelado, Tenorio, Cucuilapa, Miravalles, Rincon de la Vieja, La Hedionda,

a state of eruption upwards of 250 years ago, and still continues active; it
had a small eruption Nov. 10, 1858; Managua; Momotombo, 6,500 ft high,
near the Managua or Leon Lake, about which the Indians had a tradition of
a tremendous eruption some 100 years before the coming of the Spaniards, the
lava running into the lake and destroying all the fish; the latter part of the
story seems to be incorrect, there being evidence that the lava did not reach
the lake shore; it partially revived in 1852; Las Pilas, Asososca, Orota, Telica,
Santa Clara, El Viejo 6,000 ft high; El Chonco; Cosigüina, whose first
eruption was Jan. 20, 1835, believed to have been the most violent ever recorded
in history; and Joltepec—all in Nic. El Tigre, Nacaome, and Amapala,
or Conchagua, in Hond. In the republic of Salv. are several; namely, the San
Salvador, which had not broken out in upwards of three centuries; but in
old times it ejected immense masses of lava and scoriæ to a distance of more
than 18 miles. It is of great depth, computed by Weems, an American who
descended it, at about 5,000 varas; the bottom is occupied by a lake; San
Miguel, about 15,000 ft high. In old times it ejected large quantities of cinders
and half-melted stones of immense size. The country for 30 miles or
more, including the site of San Miguel, one of the oldest towns in Am., being
covered with lava and scoriæ; San Vicente; Izalco, which broke out about
100 years ago, is in constant activity, but has not caused any serious damage;
Paneon, and Santa Ana. In Guat. are the Pacaya; the Volcan de Agua; the
Volcan de Fuego constantly smoking with occasional explosion and shocks,
its last eruption being in 1880; Encuentro, Acatenango; Atitlan so remarkable
at one time for frequent and violent eruptions, the last ones being in 1828 and
1833, which caused much destruction on the coast of Suchitepequez; Tesamielco,
Zapotitlan, Amilpas, Quezaltenango, and Cerro Quemado whose last
eruption was in 1785. There are many other nameless ones. Near a number
of the active and extinct volcanoes are small and almost circular openings
in the ground, through which is ejected smoke or steam. The natives call
them ausoles or infiernillos, little hells. <i>Dunlop's Cent. Am.</i>, 3, 13-17, 52-5,

since that of 1773. Feb. and Sept. 1831, a great part of San Salvador was
ruined. The authorities and most of the people fled to Cojutepeque. This
was the sixth time the city had been more or less damaged by earthquakes.
Sept. 2, 1841, Cartago, in Costa R., was nearly levelled to the ground; of
3,000 houses previously existing, not 100 remained entire; of the 8 churches,
the smallest and ugliest was the only one escaping uninjured. May 1844,
the city of Granada was nearly ruined; the town of Nicaragua was greatly
damaged, the lake of this name rising and falling several times, as if having
a tide. Amatitlan, Petapa, Palin, and other places near the volcano of Pacaya,
hardly had a house left standing in the end of March and in beginning
of April 1845. In the repub. of Guat. shocks have been repeatedly experienced,
those of 1884 and 1885 causing devastation in Amatitlan. San Salvador
experienced heavy ones in 1575, 1593, 1625, 1656, and 1798, and was
completely ruined in 1839, 1854, and 1873, and several other towns in the
republic fared almost as badly in the latter year. Oct. 2, 1878, there was
loss of life. Dec. 27-29, 1879, Ilopango, Candelaria, and other places were
demolished. In Costa R. the destruction of Puntarenita occurred Aug. 4,
1854; and in 1882 the towns of Alajuela, San Ramon, Grecia, and Heredia
were damaged, with heavy loss of life. In Dec. 1867, a tidal wave swallowed
the island of Zapotilla, in Golfo Dulce, drowning all the inhabitants.
The earthquake shocks seem to be of two kinds, namely, the perpendicular,
which are felt only in the vicinity of volcanoes, and the horizontal, reaching
great distances from the places where they originate, being very unequal in
their progress, in some parts rocking the ground violently, and in others, in
their direct line, nearer their source, being but slightly felt. <i>Dunlop's Cent.

subterraneous outlet exists, as in the lakes of Guijar and Metapa in Salv.,
which are united by a subterraneous communication. Golfo Dulce, or Izabal
Lake, of about 50 miles in circuit, subject to violent agitations, and forming
the port of Izabal on the Atlantic coast of Guat. The small Amatitlan, about
20 miles from the city of Guat., which, notwithstanding its hot springs and
brackish waters, abounds in a delicate fish called mojarra, in other small fish,
and in wild fowl. In Hond. is the Yojos. In Nic., the lake of the same
name, whose surplus waters run to the Atlantic by the San Juan del Norte
River; an inland sea, 96 miles long, and 40 miles in its greatest breadth,
forming an ellipse with its main axis due N. W. to S. E. Its depth in some
parts is of 45 fathoms, and its area must be at least 2,000 square miles. It
contains a small archipelago. Lake Managua is 38 or 35 miles in length, and
16 in its greatest breadth. It has little depth, and several sand banks render

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-21'>[XXVII-21]</a></span> San José, the national capital, was founded a little more than 100 years
ago, owing its existence to the earthquakes which nearly destroyed Cartago,
the old capital. San José is situated on an elevation of about 4,500 ft., upon
the table-land formed between the mountains of Dota or Herradura on the
south, and those of Barba on the north. On one side flows the river Torres,
and on the other the María Aguilar. Its streets are paved, straight, and
forming right angles. The dwellings are mostly of a single story, with spacious
courts; there are, however, a good many buildings of two stories. The
majority are made of adobe, plastered over; but the national palace is of stone,
and a fine building. An aqueduct supplies the city with water from the Torres,
though a large portion of the fluid consumed is drawn from the wells existing
in almost every house. Besides, the government palace, the university,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXVII-29'>[XXVII-29]</a></span> Granada has a good commercial position on the N. W. end of Lake Nicaragua,
and at the foot of the Mombacho volcano. It was burned by pirates
in 1665, nearly ruined by the freebooters in 1670, the raiders having come on
both occasions by the San Juan River and the lake; and a third time destroyed
by fire in 1685, the work of pirates who landed at Escalante on the Pacific.
In 1844 it was greatly damaged by earthquakes. In 1856 it was burned by
William Walker, the filibuster. But it has risen from its ashes, and become
prosperous. The city is irregular in its construction, the streets not being
straight or rectangular. They are mostly unpaved, and generally in a bad
condition. The city obtains water for consumption from the lake, distant
about a mile, brought by men on their shoulders; and its food supplies, not
from the surrounding fields, but from numerous Indian pueblos on the S. E.
Masaya was an Indian town, but raised to the rank of a city in 1839. <i>Rocha</i>,
<i>Cód. Nic.</i>, i. 148. It is supplied with water from the deep lagoon south of
and near the city. There were women who for 80 cents monthly supplied
two large jars of water every day. A steam-pump was put up in 1872 to
raise the water of the lake to the plaza. There is no building worthy of mention
in the place. Other notable towns in the department of Granada are
Nandaimé, Jinotepe, San Rafael de la Costa, Diriomo, Tipitapa, Nindirí, and
Zapatera Island. The towns of San Cárlos and El Castillo, on the San Juan,
belong to the same department, though governed in a special manner. San
Juan del Norte, alias Greytown, has little importance now; its houses are of
wood and palm-thatched. Rivas bore the name of Nicaragua till the early
part of the present century. The city has suffered greatly from earthquakes,
particularly in 1844. It was partially destroyed during the Walker war.
A real curiosity in the department of Rivas is the island of Ometepe in the
lake, having two towns, the Pueblo Grande, or villa de Altagracia, and the
Moyogalpa, united by a good wagon road. Chinandega is one of the most
beautiful spots in Nic. It is a perfect garden. In the wild or uncivilized
portion of the territory lies the Mosquito region, whose chief town is Blewfields,
having two wooden buildings; the rest being mere huts. <i>Lévy</i>, <i>Nic.</i>,

ground, but the back country rises rapidly into a chain of high mountains,
beginning abruptly at Puerto Caballos, now called Puerto Cortés. Owing to
its position, Omoa is generally cool and healthy, has seldom been visited by
epidemics. The place is defended by the San Fernando castle. Trujillo lies
close by the sea at the foot of a lofty mountain covered with vegetation, and
reaching to the very edge of the water. The town was at one time of considerable
importance, both in a commercial and military point of view; but now
it has an antique, dilapidated, and abandoned appearance. Amapala, on the
island of Tigre, was in old times a favorite resort of pirates; it was here that
Drake had his depot during his operations in the Pacific. Owing to the visits
of those marauders, the Indian population of Tigre and Zacate Grande retired
to the mainland, and the islands remained almost entirely deserted till 1838,
when Amapala was made a free port, since which time it has become a very
important place. It has a salubrious climate. Further details on the towns

the gold placers in California, the town had a gloomy and ruinous aspect.
There was nothing to be seen all around but ruin and poverty; whole blocks
and streets of old, dilapidated buildings, propped-up houses with people
living in them, and luxuriant vegetation in the plazas, walls, etc. With the
coming of foreigners a great change took place within the short space of three
or four years. Nearly all the old dwellings underwent repairs, and new ones
were built. In lieu of the old sad appearance and silence, all was now bustle
and movement. <i>Maldonado</i>, <i>Asuntos Polít. Pan.</i>, MS., 7.

Dec. 4, 1877. The population was computed in 1810 at different figures, none
reliable. The one deemed most accurate was as follows: 646,666 Indians,
313,334 mulattoes and some negroes, 40,000 whites, making a total of 1,000,000,
probably including 100,000 for Chiapas. <i>Guat.</i>, <i>Apuntam.</i>, 105, 110; <i>Salv.</i>,

Cent. Am., in 1823 estimated 2,000,000 in the following proportions: one fifth
of whites, two fifths of mixed classes, and two fifths of Indians. <i>Narr. Official
Visit</i>, 451. Galindo, an intelligent officer of the Cent. Am. govt, about
1837 set the population at 685,000 Ind., 740,000 ladinos or mestizos, and 475,000
whites; total, 1,900,000. He evidently overestimated the number of
whites. Crowe, <i>Gospel</i>, 40, referring specifically to Guat., estimated the number
of pure whites at not over 5,000, which seems to be short of the truth.
The proportions he gave were: Indians, three fifths; ladinos or mestizos, one
fourth; whites, one fortieth; mulattoes, one eighty-third; negroes, one fiftieth;
zambos, one hundredth. It is unnecessary to burden this note with figures
for each year after 1837. I will merely append those for 1866, given by a
writer who must have got his data from reliable sources: Costa R., 150,000,
mostly white, and including from 5,000 to 10,000 Talamanca Indians. According
to a Costa Rica census, there were in the republic in 1864 112 persons
of 90 years and upwards; of whom 14 were of 100, 4 of 102, one of 103, one of

extended and nailed to a wooden frame, supported by four legs. At each
end rises a pillar to sustain a sort of awning which covers the whole bed, and
answers also for a mosquito net. The appurtenances of the bed are a mat,

meat and greens, followed by a stew of beef, pork, fish, or fowl, with some
vegetables, and dessert in the form of a variety of dulces. Rice is as necessary
at dinner as beans at breakfast. Between breakfast and dinner, fruits or
some cooling beverage are partaken of. Supper is a frugal meal, accompanied
with chocolate, or tiste, which is the national beverage of Nic.—a mixture of
cacao, and ground roasted corn, beaten in cold water with sugar. Wheaten
bread is made of imported flour; but it is too expensive for general use, and
is generally sweetened. The tortilla of Nic. is larger, thicker, and of coarser
dough than in other parts. In many places it is considered '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">artículo de lujo,</span>'
and instead of it, boiled or roasted green plantains are used. Wine is rarely
brought into requisition. The only fermented liquor in common use is the
aguardiente distilled from molasses, which only the lower classes drink, and
not to excess. The poorer classes are very irregular in their eating, for they
eat at all hours; living mostly on plantains, beans, cheese, and chicharrones
and other fat portions of pork. Fruit in superabundance is eaten. <i>Lévy</i>, <i>Nic.</i>,

<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXX-6'>[XXX-6]</a></span> Early in 1872 the university of Leon, the former Colegio Tridentino, had
but three chairs and 66 alumni, and four classes of secondary instruction
attended by 102 pupils; that of Granada had only a chair of law, and seven
classes of secondary instruction attended by 160 pupils. In primary instruction,
there were at that time only 92 schools for boys and 9 for girls, a number
of them private, and one missionary in Cuapa, attended by 3,871 boys
and 532 girls, out of a population of 205,500, or say 20 children out of 1,000
inhabitants; only 532 girls out of 18,000 of school age, and 4,000 boys out of
12,000, were receiving instruction. <i>Lévy</i>, <i>Nic.</i>, 360-3. Teachers of pub.
schools are paid $12 a month and a little extra in larger towns. That state of
things was due mainly to the neglect of parents. The funds appropriated for
education were constantly tampered with and defrauded; this was acknowledged
by the minister of instruction. There were no schools for adults, no
professional institutes. As a rule, wealthy families sent their sons to be educated
abroad, or at least in Guat. There was in 1873 no scientific course
provided with the requisite materials, no laboratories, no museum, no public
or private collections, no observatory, nothing; not even a small library.
The conclusion to be drawn from the above is that the general intellectual
level could not be high.

of Tegucigalpa, Choluteca, and Gracias are very rich in silver in
various combinations. The upper or old mine of Coloal yielded 58 per ct. of
copper, and 78 to 84 ounces of silver to the ton; the ores of the new mines
of Coloal, a combination of chloride of silver, a little sulphuret of silver,
oxide of iron, and antimony, mixed with earthy matter, yielded 8,470 ounces
per ton of 2,000 lbs. Gold mines abound in Hond., but only a few have been
worked. The chief supplies have been drawn from the washings of Olancho.
The rivers of Guayape and Jalan, as well as the streams running into them,
are decidedly the richest in auriferous sands. The finest gold is from the
Guayape, Jalan, and Mangualil, and from the Sulaco, Caimito, and Pacaya,
in the dept of Yoro. The southern districts bordering on Nic. have rich
placers. Hond. has also mines of copper, iron, platina, cinnabar, zinc, and
coal. Very productive opal mines are worked to some extent in Gracias.

Several silver mines promise large yields when they become exploited. The
Indians of Zunil repeatedly offer for sale in Quezaltenango quicksilver obtained
from a mine which they keep strictly secret. In the departments of Quiché,
Alta, Vera Paz, and Huehuetenango are salt springs and deposits; in Chimaltenango
peat and lignite; between Guastoya and Izabal, marble; and in several
places on the Atlantic slope, coal. The government had a mineralogical

The mines of lead, iron, and copper are believed to be inexhaustible. They
are situated in a fertile, cool, healthy, and picturesque region, affording
every other facility for working them. The whole northern frontier abounds
in silver, a little of it being obtained by primitive processes. Quicksilver
mines, though not rich, are common. The gold veins of Nic. come from
Hond., running along the cordillera to the San Juan River, where they become
somewhat ramified before crossing it, and reappear in Costa R. The chief
one crosses the Machuca River. The gold is almost pure when washed from
river-beds, and more or less mixed with silver when dug out of the earth.
In the districts of Juigalpa and Libertad hundreds of mines have been entered.
The Jícaro mines near Trinidad, and those of Santa Rosa, Achuapa,
San Francisco, etc., have been famous. The Potosí and Corpus in colonial
times yielded large quantities of gold. The whole upper region of the Coco
River is rich. It may be asserted that the mines of Nic. are excellent, but
the miners are generally incompetent. They use the crowbar, avoiding gunpowder
as too expensive. Men are easily procured, who work steadily though
slowly and by primitive methods, earning $8 to $10 per month, and their
rations. The mills are mostly poor. Sixteen carat gold is worth at the mine
$12 an ounce, but the average price paid by factors was $8 or $9. Considerable
quantities of gold are taken by the Indians from river sands and bed,
and washed in pans. <i>Lévy</i>, <i>Nic.</i>, 160-6, 482-6; <i>Squier's Cent. Am.</i>, 364, 392-400;

India-rubber, hides, and indigo; also rice, mules, cacao, pork, horns, timber,
sarsaparilla, vanilla, tobacco, etc. Cochineal at one time was a great staple,
the export being nearly 68,000 centals in 1860-4, and about 59,000 centals in
1870-4; reduced to about 2,845 in 1879-83. The principal importations were
comestibles, wines and liquors, cotton, linen, woollen, and silk fabrics, clothing,
hats, fancy goods, furniture, arms, articles for agric., arts, and sciences.
Arms, lead, and gunpowder might not be imported without special permission
of the govt. Some articles were exempt from duty, such as material for ship-building,
instruments for medicine, surgery, science, schools, arts, implements
of agric., machinery, and tools for manuf., steam-engines, money, gold, silver,
guano, mineral, coal, etc. Articles of luxury paid an import duty; foreign
manufactures entered with a high duty. Small amounts should be paid at
the time of entry in cash; and larger sums, part at the adjustment of the
duties, and the rest in instalments of from one to three months. The republic
has several ports open to foreign commerce on both oceans; namely, Santo
Tomás, Livingston, and Golfo Dulce, which is navigable only for vessels of
light draught, on the Atlantic, and San José, San Luis, Champerico, and
Ocós on the Pacific. Iztapam or Independencia was closed in 1853, and the
custom-house removed to the roadstead of San José, which is sheltered
by a bold breakwater. Actual value of foreign trade: imports, 1851-7,

The average of importations in the five years 1880-4 was $2,700,000. The
largest importations in 1883 were from G. Britain, including Belize, $884,205;
U. S., $529,458; France, $149,687; Germany, $128,296; Switzerland, $76,278;
Spain, $65,470; China, $54,855. The rest from Belgium, Cent. Am., Italy,
Colombia, and Denmark. The war between Guat. and Salv., and revolution
in Pan., paralyzed trade in 1885. It is noticed that notwithstanding the
greater proximity and wealth of the U. S., Guatemala's commercial relations

was also a prominent staple, followed by India-rubber. The number of merchant
vessels which visited Guat. ports on the Pac. during 1883 were 7
steamers of the Pac. Mail S. Co., which made their periodical trips; 3 stmrs.
of the Kosmos (German) line, to which special privileges were granted by the
Guat. govt, in 1882. Sailing vessels, 6 Am., 1 Eng., 6 French, 3 German,
and 1 Salvadoran. To Livingston, on the Atlantic, came monthly 4 Am.
and one Eng. steamer. Seven vessels did coasting trade under the Eng.
flag. Vessels arrived in 1884, 171 with 173,982 tons; departed 168 with 173,758
tons, carrying away 109,402 packages of merchandise and products of the

Salvador: articles of export, indigo, coffee, sugar, tobacco, caoutchouc,
rebozos, balsam, hides, and cotton. Imports: comestibles, wines and liquors,
cotton, linen, woollen, and silk fabrics, hardware, etc. The ports of entry
were La Union, La Libertad, and Acajutla. Imported goods pay duties according
to the tariff, which were mostly specific, but many articles paid, besides,
20 per cent ad valorem. Products of the other Central American
states on being imported, reciprocity existing, paid only 4 per cent ad val.
Articles intended for the development of industries and education were
exempt. The importation of arms, without special leave of the government,
alcohol and common rum, cognac, gin, absinthe, aniseseed, coriander, sassafras,
saltpetre, and obscene images was forbidden. Products of the country
were free from export dues, except indigo, ores, gold and silver bullion, and
jewelry. Import values: 1855-61, $6,816,879; 1864, $1,233,711; 1866-8,

<i>Nic.</i>, <i>Gaceta</i>, Feb. 21, 1874. Lévy, a good authority, gives the imports for
1865-71 at $6,275,324, adding that in the first two years the balance of trade
was against Nic. to the amount of $453,429; 1873-6, $4,313,876; 1877-80,
$5,117,661; 1881-4, $7,157,525; these figures include about half a million
dollars in coin. Wholesale merchants sold at long terms, often 18 months;
most of the buyers disposed of the goods at once, with 20 per ct loss, but for
cash, and during 17 months' use of the capital making as much as 50 per ct
profit, which enabled them to pay for the merchandise originally bought.
Exports: 1861-73, $4,153,677, without including for 1871-2. Lévy has for
1865-71, $6,789,841; 1873-6, $5,694,009; 1877-80, $6,303,589; 1881-4, $8,926,965.
In view of the fall in the price of coffee in late years in foreign
markets, and of the decrease in the production of rubber, there was cause to
fear that the day was not distant when the balance of trade would be against
Nic., unless with the facilities afforded by the railroads the exportations of
timber and dye-woods should be greatly developed, as expected. The exports
of cattle to the other states of Cent. Am. have become quite considerable.
The two chief centres of internal trade were Granada and Leon, which supplied
their own departments. Chontales was supplied from the former, Segovia
from the latter, Matagalpa from both. Rivas and Chinandega imported
a portion of their supplies, buying the rest respectively at Granada and Leon.
Rivas furnished cacao; Jinotepeque and Chinandega, sugar; Leon, corn and
salt; Masaya and other towns, edibles.

Costa Rica imported cotton, linen, woollen, and silk fabrics, fancy articles,
comestibles, wines, liquors, and other things, from England, France, U. S.,
etc., and exported chiefly coffee, tortoise-shells, hides, rubber, vanilla, sarsaparilla,
timber, etc. Her ports for foreign trade are at present Limon on
the Atlantic, and Puntarenas on the Pacific; the latter being, down to 1883,
almost the only port of Costa Rica; but of late the former, owing to railroad
facilities, has obtained the first rank; shipments through Puntarenas being
mainly of produce from Esparta, and other places near it. It was a free port
at one time, but ceased to be such in Jan. 1861. In earlier years Matina
and Caldera had been open ports, and even Guanacaste was made a free port
in 1848. Port Limon was created in Oct. 1852; it has a free zone under decrees
passed in 1883. Costa Rica's import values: 1845, $463,000, through
Matina and Puntarenas; 1852-9, $7,330,398; 1864, $1,718,000; 1871, $2,225,000;
1873-4, $6,980,000; 1877, about $2,000,000; 1880-3, $7,220,000. Exports:

and Limon in 1884 were 191,719 centals. Large quantities of bananas
were also exported from Limon. Vessels arrived in 1882-3, at Limon 86, at

Miguel, in Salvador. That of San Miguel took place in November, and lasted
two weeks. There was another fair at the same town about the beginning of
Feb., to which, as well as to the former one, large numbers of cattle were taken
from Hond. and Nic. In Guat. annual fairs were held in several places;
namely, Esquipulas, where large quantities of merchandise were sold; it was
also a cattle fair; Rabinal in Vera Paz, for dry goods; Mazatenango, for cattle,
cacao, dry goods, etc.; San Pedro Ayampuk; Sololá, for dry goods, fruit, and
stock; Quezaltenango and Chimaltenango, for woollen manufactures. In
Jocotenango a fair was held every Aug. In later times fairs have been authorized
at several other places, to wit, at the hippodrome, near the capital, Salcajá,
Santa Cruz del Quiché, Jalapa, Santa Rosa, and San Pedro Pinula.

Vanderbilt and White were the chief owners, undertook to construct an
interoceanic canal. Their contract with the Nic. govt involved the privilege
to the company of exclusive steam navigation in the interior waters, meaning
Lake Nicaragua. The company concluded to separate this privilege from the
rest of the contract, and succeeded, Aug. 1851, in obtaining from the Nic.
govt the monopoly of transit from San Juan del Norte to San Juan del Sur.
It is unnecessary to go into details as to how this was consummated; suffice
it to say, it was by fostering the intestine war then raging. <i>U. S. Gov. Doc.</i>,

Salvador began business on the 20th of Aug., 1880, and has since been prosperous,
excepting in 1885, owing to the war with Guatemala, and a subsequent
revolution. However, the results of the first six months were satisfactory.
In 1867 the Banco Nacional de Costa Rica went into operation at San
José, with a capital of $500,000, and power to increase it to one million dollars,
under a contract for ten years between John Thompson and the government.
Dec. 1, 1876, the government decreed the statutes of the <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Banco de Emision</span>,
with a capital of $500,000 secured with mortgages on real estate to the amount
of $1,000,000. But the stockholders failing to pay in the capital, the government
suspended the bank, which had been operating, and ordered the books
transferred to the Banco Nacional of San José, which was to redeem all notes
of that bank in circulation. The Banco Nacional had been created by a decree
of Dec. 25, 1877, with a capital of $250,000. Its operations were not to
include the issue of notes. A charter was granted in Jan. 1881, to establish
a <span lang="es" xml:lang="es">Banco Hipotecario Franco-Costaricense</span>  with a capital of $500,000. The by-laws
were approved by govt in July 1881. The bank was to have a branch

Panamá, via Cartago in Costa Rica, by which route correspondence was kept
up with South America. In 1811 a tri-monthly mail was established between
Guat. and Mex., Merida, the Windward Islands, and Spain. In 1829 there
was a monthly packet between New York and the Isthmus. After that,
some sort of mail service was kept up till it became regular with the establishment
of steamship lines. In 1844 the first mail steamer touched at Chagres,
and in 1845 a line was established between Panamá and Valparaiso. In
1846 a post-route between the two oceans was established under a grant of the
Brit. govt. At this time the U. S. contemplated establishing a line of
steamers from Pan. to Or. via Cal. The present Pacific Mail Steamship
Company was organized in 1847 for that purpose, and on the 5th of
Oct. their pioneer steamship, the <i>California</i>, went to sea, followed at short
intervals by the <i>Panamá</i> and <i>Oregon</i>. At the inception of the enterprise,
success was looked for only from the agricultural resources of the Pacific
coast. The discovery of gold in Cal. secured that success. The company
kept up the service between N. Y. and Colon, and between Panamá and
S. F. via Acapulco and Manzanilla, and later sent ships to China. <i>Niles'

549,096, in 1880, and 1,172,259, in 1882. In Nic. the service is a source of
considerable expense to the govt. In 1861-2, the expenses were only $5,349.
In 1881-2, $39,327; the receipts $19,476, leaving a deficit of $19,851. This is
owing to long distances and sparse population. In Hond. the exchange of
mail matter amounted in 1880 to 937,331 pieces; the expenses of the department,
$17,102. In Guat. the aggregate amount of mail matter was as follows:

$19,062,567; jewelry, $513,001; 1855-66: merchandise, mail matter, baggage
and coal, 614,535 tons. Mail matter averaged 380 tons yearly. Merchandise
steadily increased from 10,658 tons in 1856, the lowest, to 93,414 tons in 1866,
the highest; and coal from 8,934 in 1856 to 13,418 in 1866. In 1860 and 1861,
the coal transportation exceeded 16,000 tons a year. The total tonnage transported
across the road in 1856 was 20,053, which increased every year till it
reached 107,590 tons in 1866. The largest number of passengers crossed was
in 1859, 46,976, nearly 5,000 in excess of 1858; the smallest number was in
1862, 26,420, being 5,280 less than in 1866. The large travel of 1859 was due
to great reduction of passage money by steam lines running in opposition.
The gold transported in 1856 was $48,047,692; in 1866, $48,234,463; at no
other period did it equal these amounts. Silver showed a gradual increase
from $9,439,648 in 1856 to $18,653,239, declining in 1866 to $14,331,751.
Paper money was transported by the U. S. govt during the war. Jewelry
varied from $192,718 to $844,490, but gradually declined. The tariff rates
established by the company Jan. 1, 1865, were as follows: passengers, foreign,
$25 each, children of 6 to 12 years one half, under 6, one quarter; Colombians,
$10 each. Baggage exceeding 50 lb., 5 cts per lb. Merchandise, special rates:

The Pacific Mail Co. of N. Y., whose capital in 1847 was $400,000; raised in 1850
to $2,000,000; in 1860 to $4,000,000; and in 1866 to $20,000,000; the lowest
estimate of its property being set down in 1867 at $30,000,000. This company
has passed through many vicissitudes, as indicated by the stock market.
The highest rates attained by its shares were 248 in 1863, 325 in 1864, 329
in 1865, 234 in 1866. Every other year they have been under 200, the highest
being in 173½ in 1867. From that time they sank very low, even to 16¼ cents
in 1876, the highest that year being 39¼. 2d. Brit. and W. India and Pac.
running between Liverpool, W. Ind., W. coast of S. and Cent. Am., and
Colon. 3d. Brit. Royal Mail, between Southampton, W. Ind., eastern coast
of Mexico, S. and Cent. Am., and Colon. 4th. Brit. Pan., New Zealand, and
Australia. 5th. Brit. Pac. Steam Navigation Co., between Pan. and ports
of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. 6th. Pan. R. Road Co.'s
steamers between Pan. and Acapulco, touching at all Cent. Am. ports. This
line finally was merged in the Pacific Mail Co. 7th. Am. Cal. Or. and Mex.
Co.'s line running between S. F. and Mex., and between S. F. and Portland,
Or., and Island of Vancouver. It was afterward discontinued. 8th. French
Transatlantic Co. running between St Nazaire in France, W. Ind., Mex., and
Colon. 9th. German line. In 1871 the following arrivals of vessels occurred:
steamers, Brit., 84, with 158,579 tons; Am., 25, with 66,813 tons; German,
36, with 42,740 tons; French, 24, with 15,782. Sailing vessels, 56 Brit., 43

no order—chronological or other—in the information he gives. The description
of the social and political condition of the city and country, to the time

In 1825 the spirit of enterprise was rash. Exclusive of small coasters, there
came to Chagres 1 ship, 7 brigs from France, 21 schooners from the W. Indies,
6 schooners from the U. S., and 3 from Cartagena. In 1828, these numbers
were reduced to about 20 all together. In the same years the entries at

The amount of exports may be augmented some $100,000 by produce

India-rubber figured considerably among the exports. The recklessness with
which the rubber-trees have been cut down has reduced the production in
1886 to an insignificant quantity. The imports from 1856 to 1863 inclusive
reached $6,386,135; the exports from 1857 to 1863 probably $5,000,000 or

and sales of spirituous liquors, tobacco, gunpowder, and stamped paper.
The total revenue of 1845 amounted to $74,911, a sum entirely inadequate to
meet the most necessary expenses of the government. The import duty was
20 per cent ad valorem, to which was added 8 per cent. The only export
duty was 1 to 3 per cent on gold, silver, and precious stones. A transit duty
of 5 per cent was levied on goods passing through Nic. to the other states.
Merchant vessels paid 50 cts per ton. The total revenue from customs in
1846 was $51,818; from internal taxation, $3,626; from rum, etc, $24,260.
The revenue from tobacco was pledged to the Brit. govt, in order to ransom
the port of San Juan del Norte. Other sources were insignificant. Receipts
of 1851, $122,686; 1857-60, $1,327,637; 1861-70, $5,665,877. The tariff of
imports was modified in Dec. 1868, and increased 10 per cent in Feb. 1870.
Agricultural implements, materials for mining, and other articles, were exempted
from import duty by a law of Nov. 2, 1869. The revenue from customs
became flourishing, and yielded in 1883 $1,275,506, due to the law of
Sept. 25, 1879, which raised the duties on several articles, and changed the
mode of collecting from ad valorem to weight. It seems that most goods
paid no more under the new system than formerly; but much fraud was
averted. Imports generally paid 50 per cent ad val. The port of San Juan
del Norte and the Mosquito reservation have a free zone, the merchants of
San Juan paying a tax in lieu of import duties. Receipts of 1871, $958,922;
1873-80, $8,416,879; 1881-2, $3,351,767, an increase of $951,674 over the

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIII-65'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIII-65'>[XXXIII-65]</a></span> The history of these loans, as furnished in the reports of the Costa Rican
treasury department, is the following: In 1871, Costa Rica contracted with
Bischoffsheim and Goldsmidt for a loan of the nominal amount of £1,000,000,
at 72 with 6 per cent interest, and 2 per cent for a sinking fund; however,
per agreement of May 5, 1871, the rate was reduced to 56, and only
yielded £560,000. Bischoffsheim and Goldsmidt retained £105,000, which
reduced the proceeds to £455,000, and this sum was further diminished
£42,000, leaving only £413,000, or somewhat less than 42 per cent. A new
loan was negotiated in 1872, with Knowles and Foster of London, which appeared
as for £2,400,000, but did not exceed £2,226,500, the difference not
having been taken up. The negotiation was at 82, with interest at 7 per
cent, and 1 per cent for a sinking fund. This loan actually yielded to Costa
Rica £598,611 18<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, which is explained thus: Knowles and Foster paid
over to E. Erlanger and Co. of London in money £1,576,240 9<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>, the difference
between this sum and that taken up being £650,259. Erlanger and
Co. were the syndics of the loan under the 8th clause of the contract with
Knowles and Foster, and had bound themselves to take up £800,000 of it.
Under the 3d and 4th clauses, they were empowered to repurchase bonds for
account of Costa Rica, though subject to the following conditions: 1st. That
the repurchasing should be indispensable to secure the success of the loan;
2d. It was not to be done with the £800,000 Erlanger and Co. were bound
for; and 3d. The operations were not to be effected but within 30 days of the
issue. This condition was violated. Erlanger and Co. claimed to have repurchased
with the money received by them bonds of both the 6 per cent and
7 per cent loans to the value of £1,426,500. The result of this transaction
was that the loan, save the £800,000 taken up by Erlanger and Co., was exhausted;
and yet it was said, in and out of Costa Rica, that her government
had received $17,000,000. <i>Encyclop. Brit.</i> (Am. ed.), vi. 398. The whole
yield of both loans was but £1,011,611 18<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>, or $5,058,060. Besides the
£105,000 retained by Bischoffsheim and Goldsmidt, under the pretext of securing
the interest of the 6 per cent loan, the government remitted for interest
and sinking fund £135,000, which were taken from the very funds
received, and reduced them to £876,611 18<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> Moreover, under an agreement
with Erlanger and Co., the government of Costa Rica was authorized to
draw on them for £150,000. Its drafts were allowed to go to protest, and the
amounts drawn for had to be replaced. The government felt that it had been
victimized, and in order to protect the country's good name, after consultation
with legal lights of London, established suits at law against the parties.
The suit has cost a great deal of money; early in 1877 $373,380 had been paid
for expense. <i>Costa R.</i>, <i>Mem. Sec. Hac.</i>, 1874-7. Should the decisions of the
British courts be against Costa Rica, her financial situation should not be
deemed very alarming, as is made apparent. The 7 per cent loan, reduced
to Costa Rican money at 9 per cent, £2,226,500, nominal $12,134,425.

1885. The general govt on the 1st of April, 1885, established a salt monopoly,
and in the same year decreed the reëstablishment of custom-houses at
the Isthmus ports. This decree was subsequently suspended. <i>La Estrella de

budgets for the ten years from 1867 to 1876 amounted together to $3,018,391,
and the appropriations voted for the same year were $3,335,084. The absence
of regular accounts for the period 1867-75 renders it impossible to find
out what were the actual receipts and expenditures. The revenue from Jan.
1, 1876, to June 30, 1877, was $339,526, and the expenses reached $356,483,
though only $274,298 were paid. The revenue collected from July 1, 1877,
to June 30, 1878, $218,095; the assembly voted for expenses of that fiscal
year $382,841, but the government seems to have paid out only $226,278.
For 1880-1 the legislature computed the revenue at $300,628. It had the
preceding year authorized the executive to increase the commercial tax 25 per
cent. The expenditures for the year were estimated at $316,077. <i>Pan.</i>, <i>Mem.

Rome in Gaul, was presented by the king of Suevia with a number of red
men, who had been thrown upon his coast. So said Cornelius Nepos, and
Pliny repeated it. Now these savages, having no knowledge of ships or navigation,
could not have come from America; they were not black, and consequently
were not from Africa. There were no people in Europe like them;
so they must have come from Asia. But how? Either from the east or from
the west; they could not have rounded the eastern hemisphere either by its
northern or southern side, for obvious reasons; therefore they must have
come from the north-west, and hence there must be a way from Asia north-eastward
to Europe, running round the north pole. Upon this logic were
staked thousands of lives and millions of money. Dominicus Marius Niger,
the geographer, speaks of men who were driven from India through the north
sea to Germany, while on a trading expedition. As late as 1160, some strange
persons arrived on the coast of Germany. Humboldt thought they might
have been Eskimos. Othon, in his <i>Storie of the Gothes</i>, speaks of such arrivals,
arguing that they must have drifted in through a north-west passage. Gilbert's
Discourse, in <i>Hakluyt</i>, iii. 16-17. Again, Hakluyt finds it recorded that
some 200 years before the coming of Christ, the Romans sent a fleet against
the Grand Khan, which, crossing the strait of Gibraltar, and steering toward
the N. W., in lat 50° found a channel, in which it sailed to the westward until
it reached Asia, and after fighting the king of Cathay, returned by the way
it went.

going on the voyage as supercargo, Van Schouten as commander. They
doubled the cape with one remaining ship in Jan. 1616. The Spaniards afterward
completed the exploration, and their forts in Magellan Sound became
useless. The straits of Magellan have been, however, used in late years as
the transit of an English steamship line.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIV-5'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIV-5'>[XXXIV-5]</a></span> Previously several attempts had been made. Kotzebue, of the Russian
navy, went in 1815 to Bering Strait, and the next year discovered the sound
bearing his name. Golovnin made a voyage also, but accomplished nothing.
The English made a number of efforts, which, if unsuccessful in not attaining
the main object, added much to geographic knowledge. Herewith I give the
expeditions fitted out in England, or under English auspices. In 1818 two
ships, the <i>Dorothea</i> and <i>Trent</i>, under Buchan and Franklin, went to the
Spitzbergen waters, but could not advance far. Two other ships, the <i>Isabella</i>
and <i>Alexander</i>, under John Ross and W. E. Parry, were ordered to Davis
Strait and verified Baffin's exploration of Baffin Bay. Ross entered Lancaster
Sound, and reached 81° 30' W. by 74° 3' N. Parry made three other voyages,
in 1819, 1821, and 1824, in the last of which one of his ships, the <i>Fury</i>, was
wrecked in seeking a passage through Regent Inlet. In 1827 he attempted
the polar voyage in sled-boats from Spitzbergen, reaching 82° 40' 30",
the farthest point hitherto attained. Capt. John Franklin tried to find the
passage overland from York Factory on the west coast of Hudson Bay. He
wintered at Fort Chepeweyan in 1819, and in the <i>Enterprise</i> in 1820. In July
1821 he navigated the Arctic sea, east of Coppermine River, a considerable
distance, hoping from the trend of the coast to reach Hudson Bay. Want
of provisions compelled the abandonment of the expedition, and after severe
hardships, and journeying 5,500 miles, reached Great Slave Lake in Dec.
1821. Lyon in 1824 attained Sir Thomas Rowe's Welcome. Franklin renewed
his land survey of the Arctic coasts, 1825-7. He wintered in 1825 on
Great Bear Lake, descended the Mackenzie, and surveyed the coast line
westward to Return Reef in 70° 26' N., and 148° 52' W. Meanwhile Richardson
and Kendall of his party made a voyage from Mackenzie to Coppermine
River, doubling several capes, and completing the survey of the coast
through 60 degrees of longitude. Beechey in 1826 in the <i>Blossom</i> explored
the coast from Kotzebue Sound to Icy Bay. One of his parties reached Cape
Barrow. He waited for Franklin till Oct. 1827, and returned home via Cape
Horn. Ross in 1829 tried to find a passage through Regent Inlet, but had
to abandon his ship in Victoria Harbor, near 70°. P. W. Dease and T.
Simpson in 1837-9 made important explorations between Point Barrow and
Mackenzie River; the portion on the east side between Point Turnagain and
the estuary of the Back's Great Fish River; and also the south sides of Victoria
Land and King William Land. John Rae of the Hudson's Bay Company surveyed
a part of the Arctic coast east. In 1845 he surveyed Regent Inlet east
and west, found an isthmus between Regent Inlet and the sea explored by
Dease and Simpson. Franklin and Crozier were despatched in May 1845 with
two stout ships, the <i>Erebus</i> and <i>Terror</i>, well supplied for three years. The
expedition sent letters from Whalefish Island, near Disco, and was last seen
on July 26th waiting to cross the 'middle ice' on to Lancaster Sound, 220 miles
distant. The orders were to proceed to about 74¼° N. lat. and 98° W. long.;
thence take a S. and W. course for Bering's Strait, the passage west from
Melville Island being precluded. A number of expeditions were despatched
in search of Franklin; namely, one under John Richardson and Rae, 1847-9;
ships <i>Enterprise</i> and <i>Investigator</i> under Ross and Bird, 1848-9; <i>Herald</i> and
<i>Plover</i> under Kellet and Moore, 1848-52; <i>North Star</i>, commanded by Saunders,
1849-50; the <i>Investigator</i> and <i>Enterprise</i>, in 1850, under McClure and
Collinson; whaler <i>Advice</i>, under Goodsir; a squadron commanded by Austin,
consisting of the <i>Resolute</i> and the <i>Assistance</i>. Capt. Ommaney with two steam
tenders under lieuts Osborn and McClintock; several ships sent by Franklin's
wife; Rae in 1851; expedition under Edward Belcher, 1852-4; ships <i>Amphitrite</i>
and <i>Plover</i>, 1852-5; McCormick in 1852; Rae in 1853-4; Anderson in
1855; and several others, among which deserve mention the American expeditions
under lieut De Haven and S. P. Griffin, E. K. Kane, Hayes, Hall,
and Schwatka; most of whom made important geographical discoveries and
found relics of Franklin's party. It was ascertained beyond a doubt that
Franklin sailed up Wellington Channel to 77°, descended by the west side of
Cornwallis Island, and wintered 1845-6 at Beechey Island. The wintering
positions of the ships were in 1846-7-8 off the north end of King William's
Island. Franklin died June 11, 1847, and the ships were abandoned near the
above spot Apr. 22, 1848, Capt. Crozier intending to lead the 105 survivors to
Great Fish River. Only 40 men reached the vicinity of this river, and all died,
according to Eskimo accounts. On this journey Lancaster Strait was connected
with the navigable channel along the continent, and the existence of the
north-west passage proved. <i>Richardson's Polar Regions</i>, 136-7, 146-9, 151-202;

other like documents lie hidden. In 1774 the Spanish officers Corral and
Cramer, after inspecting the route reported that a canal of about eight leagues
might join the Chimalapa and Malpaso rivers, and establish a communication
between the two streams. The Spanish general Orbegoso in 1821 explored this
isthmus, and formed a map, which was not published till 1839. In 1825 he
showed that it was not easy to carry a through-canal across Tehuantepec. In
1842-3 a survey was made under the auspices of José de Garay by C. Moro
and others, to determine the practicability of a ship canal by way of the
Coatzacoalcos to the gulf of Tehuantepec. The objections to the route were
shown to be the expense of cutting, the uncertainty of water upon the summit
level, and inadequate ports at the termini. Garay, however, announced
as practicable a canal of the same size as the Caledonia, in Scotland, and was
put in possession of lands, etc.; but nothing came of the transaction but diplomatic
complications resulting from Garay's transfer of his grant to a foreign
company. Finally, the Mexican congress in 1851 declared the grant forfeited.

who reported it to possess but little 'merits as a practicable line for the construction
of a ship canal.' <i>Davis' Report</i>, 5-6. In 1869 officers of the U. S.
surveyed the route, and made a favorable report. In 1870 Capt. R. W.
Shuffeldt, of the U. S. navy, made another survey, which confirmed the conclusions
of the former, to the effect that no extraordinary engineering difficulties
existed, as sufficient water could be had from rivers in the Sierra
Madre to supply the canal. The route begins about 30 miles above the mouth
of the Coatzacoalcos, and after traversing a long distance, rises to a level of
about 680 ft, then descends to the lagoon on the Pacific, a total distance of
120 miles. The distance from New Orleans to Hongkong would be 8,245

The plan not only engaged the Spaniards but the French and English, the
latter contemplating the conquest of the country. The royal engineer Manuel
Galisteo in 1781, the system of locks being little known then, declared the
connection of the lake with the Pacific to be impracticable. In 1791 La Bastide
proposed widening the river Sapoa between the lake and Papagayo Gulf,
and cutting a canal between that river and the gulf of Nicoya; but the French
revolution caused the matter to be forgotten. In 1814 the Spanish córtes
decreed the survey and construction, but subsequent political events made
that decree inoperative. <i>Saravia</i>, <i>Bosq. Polít. Est.</i>, 13-17; <i>Viajero</i>, <i>Univ.</i>,

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIV-14'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIV-14'>[XXXIV-14]</a></span> Herewith I give a synopsis of what occurred. In 1823 a franchise was
given to John Baily for a house in London, who did nothing, and the privilege
was granted to parties in New York, who also failed to carry out the
stipulations. Numerous proposals came between 1825 and 1829, which were
successively accepted, but neither of them had effect. In 1829 a franchise
was decreed to the king of Holland, and there was some prospect of a canal
being constructed; but the war which detached Belgium from Holland broke
out, and the king abandoned the project. President Morazan then contemplated
doing the work on Central American account, and the survey was
begun in 1837, interrupted by Morazan's fall, but continued in 1838 for account
of Nicaragua. This same year Edward Belcher, of the Brit. navy,
suggested the possibility of an artificial communication between Lake Managua
and the bay of Fonseca. Baily's explorations along the line from Rio
Lajas to San Juan del Sur were terminated in 1843, and their publication
furnished exact data on the canal. Meanwhile, P. Rouhand (1839), Viteri
(1840), Castellon and Jerez (1842), had unsuccessfully tried to raise funds for
the work in Europe. The king of France in 1844 refused his coöperation.
In 1846 Louis Napoleon became warmly interested for a time. Great Britain in
1847 seized San Juan del Norte on the north, and Tiger Island on the south.
Louis Napoleon turned his thoughts to other subjects. Örsted studied, in
1847-8, for the Costa Rican govt, a canal project which differed from Baily's
in choosing a low line south of San Juan del Sur along the Sapoa River into
Salinas Bay. Nicaragua in 1848 entered into a contract to build the canal
with a house in New York, which, however, surrendered it. <i>Baily's Cent. Am.</i>,

nearly following that of the Transit Co. without passing through the valley of
the Lajas, which Baily recommended in 1843. In 1853 E. G. Squier tried to
revive Belcher's plan of utilizing both lakes, and reaching Fonseca Bay
through the Conejo Valley and the Estero Real. Squier's proposed Honduras
railway also was to reach that bay; and it is quite possible that he contemplated
connecting the two works. Felix Belly, for Belly, Millaud, and Company,
in a contract of May 1858 with the Nicaraguan government, purposed
carrying into execution Örsted's proposition; but after several years' waiting
without Belly or his assigns, the International Canal Co., accomplishing anything,
or offering better prospects for the future, the government, in 1868,
declared his contract forfeited, and entered into another with Michel Chevalier,
from which better expectations were entertained; but they were destined
not to be realized. Chevalier required, as a condition sine qua non, that the
contract should be ratified by the Costa Rican congress. This took place a
year later, and then came the war between France and Prussia, and Nicaragua's
last effort, like all former ones, was frustrated. <i>Belly</i>, <i>Nic.</i>, i. 31-50,

of a practicable route for a canal with Lake Nicaragua as its summit
level, 107 ft above mean tide. It was proposed to connect the lake with the
Pacific by a canal 16.3 miles in length, from the mouth of the Medio River
to Port Brito. The first 7.5 miles would require an excavation averaging 54
ft in depth, which would be the most costly part of the work. The plan calls
for ten locks, and one tide-lock between the lake and the sea. The lake navigation
is of 56 miles. The river San Juan would be improved by means of
four dams; namely, at the rapids of Castillo, Balas, and Machuca, and at the
mouth of the San Cárlos River, all of which places are suitable for dams. A
short section of canal with one lock would be needed to get around each of
the upper three dams. From the fourth dam to San Juan del Norte, an independent
canal 41.4 miles long with 7 locks must be constructed, which presents
no apparent engineering difficulty. The total length of the canal would
be 61.7 miles. No tunnelling needed. The harbor of San Juan del Norte
must be dredged, and otherwise improved, to insure that no water but that of
the canal shall run into the harbor. Short breakwaters must be built to protect
the entrances from the surf. Lake Nicaragua with a surface of 2,700 sq.
miles, and a drainage area of 8,000 sq. miles, will supply 38 times the maximum
possible demand of water. The depth of water would be 26 ft; the
width at bottom 72 ft, and at surface 150 ft. The locks, 21 in number, with
a lift of from 8 to 10 ft, would be 400 ft long, 72 ft wide. The cost was estimated
at about eighty million dollars. <i>U. S. Gov. Doc.</i>, <i>Sen. Jour.</i>, 916, Cong.

the three divisions. The proposed locks have a uniform length of 650 ft between

ridge by means of a tunnel 120 ft high and 17,390 ft long, to the bay
of Vaca del Monte, 12 miles west of Panamá. The route follows the Bernardino
and Caimito valleys on the southern slope, and those of Quebrado and
Chagres on the northern. The highest elevation 459 feet above the sea level,
the mountain being tunnelled 324 feet 9 in. below its highest point; so that
the canal would at the summit be 135 feet above the sea, and require 35 locks.
Lloyd, acting for the British government, arrived at the same conclusions.

the Atrato. W. B. Liot, of the Brit. navy, proposed in 1845 a macadamized
road, or a railroad from Portobello to Panamá. Capt. Kellet, being informed
by Indians that the Napipi River, a tributary of the Atrato, approached very
closely to the bay of Cupica, crossed on foot in 1847 till he reached a river
which was supposed to flow into the Atlantic. Cullen claimed to have crossed
the Darien. In 1849 he found the Sabana River, ascended it, crossed from
Cañasas to the sea-shore at Port Escocés and returned. In 1850 and 1851 he
crossed several times alone by different routes from the Sabana to Escocés,
convinced that this must be the future route for ships. Here are the requisite
secure harbors; the highest elevation of the valleys through the ridges is
not over 150 feet, which is lower than any level as yet found; locks and tunnel
might be avoided; the canal need be only 26 or 27 miles long, two miles
through hard rock. Unfortunately, Cullen gave no notes or measurements to
prove this. Capt. Fitz-Roy, of the British navy, published a memoir on a
communication between the Atrato, by way of its tributary the Napipi or
Naipi, and Cupica Bay. Greiff, a Swedish engineer, confirmed his observations.

Chauncey, and John L. Stephens, all of New York, who on the 15th of April,
1850, made a contract with the New Granadan government, binding themselves
to construct within a given time a railway between a point on the
Atlantic and Panamá, for the transportation of travellers, cattle, merchandise,
etc., under a fixed tariff of rates. Certain advantages were allowed New
Granadan citizens. It is not necessary to state here all the terms of the contract.
It was to be in force 49 years, and the New Granadan government
was to receive three per centum of the net profits. It subsequently received
$10,000 a year additional on the mails. Passengers, merchandise, and everything
else passing in transitu over the railroad, were to be free of duties and imposts.
The contract was amended July 5, 1867. Under the new arrangement
the company was to own the railway for 99 years; and pay the Colombian government
one million dollars in gold, and thereafter $250,000 a year in quarterly
instalments, Colombian mails passing over the road free of expense.
Large grants of land were made to the company, who further bound themselves
to carry the railroad to the islands of Naos, Culebra, Perico, and Flamenco,
or to some other suitable place on the bay. The prolongation has never

of opening a canal between Caledonia Bay and the gulf of San Miguel.
<i>Cullen's Darien Ship Canal</i>, 1-146. Gisborne thought it was a mere matter of
excavation costing about sixty million dollars. After having spent a great
deal of time on the examination of the Atrato and San Juan rivers since
1852, F. M. Kelly, of N. Y., in 1864 explored the route from Chepo River
to the gulf of San Blas, which is only 30 miles long, but calls for a tunnel.
Several surveys followed; namely, Strain, of the U. S. navy, early in 1854,
with a party explored the Darien. After several weeks' toil they lost themselves;
five men perished, the rest reaching Yavisa on the east coast. About
the same time a New Granadan expedition under Codazzi made a similar attempt,
but meeting with disaster, after losing several men, gave up the
enterprise. The same year English and French officers made explorations.
Cullen and Gisborne were with them, and saw their former statements
proved false. Next in order is Kennish's examination, followed by Michler
and Cravens, of the U. S. navy, who confirmed his report in all essential
points. <i>Scherzer</i>, <i>Cent. Am.</i>, 250-1; <i>Mex. Anales Min. Fomento</i>, i. 83-8;

from the Pacific with 25 men to the mouth of the Lara, and thence across the
Isthmus to Chucunaque River, reaching it just below the Sucubti. Here
the natives left him for fear of the savages, and he had to return. Rear-adm.
C. H. Davis, supt of the U. S. Naval Observatory at Washington,
issued a <i>Report</i> on Interoceanic Canals and Railways, for his government, in
1867, reviewing modern explorations of the continent from Darien to Honduras
for canals and railroad routes, and giving maps thereof, and a list of authorities
thereon. His work is quite thorough to its date. <i>Davis' Rept</i>, 15-19.
The secretary of the U. S. navy thus summarized in 1873 the report of
Com. Selfridge, who, in 1870-2, made a thorough exploration of several lines
in the narrower portion of Darien. This route includes 100 miles of navigation
of the Atrato River, which is capable of being navigated by the largest
steamers. Between the Atrato and the Pacific, a canal must be made of 28
miles in length, of which it would pass 22 through a plain with a gradual
rise of 90 feet. Of the other 6 three would be in moderate cutting, the other
three would be of tunnelling. The estimated cost was between $52,000,000
and $63,000,000, and the time for completing the work ten years. The tunnel
would be 112 ft high, 60 feet wide, and have 87 ft of clear headway above
the surface of the water. The canal would have 25 ft in depth, 50 ft of
width at the bottom, and 70 at surface. The locks, 20 in number, were to
be 427 ft long, 54 ft wide, with a lift of 10 ft. The water supply, much in
excess of the requirement, would be derived from the Napipi River. Two
alternative schemes were also presented, increasing the length of tunnelling,
and diminishing the number of locks, at an estimated cost of $85,000,000 to
$90,000,000. He proved De Puydt's line impracticable. Selfridge's full

of the Atrato, more to the north, which was regarded as more favorable.
The Am. govt despatched two other expeditions in 1874, one of which surveyed
a line between the Atrato and the Pacific across the state of Cauca;
the other a line parallel with the Panamá railway.

is there less than 290 ft high. The watershed being nearer the Pacific than
the Atlantic, the streams running into the former ocean are of little importance,
whereas the Chagres on the Atlantic slope, with its tributary, the
Obispo, forms a navigable channel, which in the rainy season attains to formidable
proportions.

both oceans; width, 22 metres at bottom, 50 metres at top; except through
the Culebra ridge, where the depth will be 9 metres, with the width of 24
metres at bottom and 28 metres at top. It must be observed that the levels
of the two oceans are not alike at all times; at Colon the difference in the
tides never exceeds 23 inches, whereas in Panamá it is usually 13 ft, and at
times nearly 20. This must produce a current in the canal sufficient to impede
navigation for several hours at each tide. The great difficulties to overcome
are the mountain and the river Chagres. The company contemplated
at first to tunnel the mountain, but gave up the plan, and resolved to cut
down through the solid strata—fortunately soft and otherwise easy—for a
depth of between 300 and 400 ft over a long distance. The next task—by far
the most difficult one—is to deal with the eccentricities of the Chagres, which
discharges at Matachin a volume of water averaging 100 cubic metres per
second, which at low water may sink to 15 or 20 cubic metres, and at flood
rise to 500 or 600. Several plans have been contemplated, one of which was
to construct an enormous dam at Gamboa, between the Obispo and Santa
Cruz hills, 960 metres at the base, 1,960 at the top, with a width at bottom,
of 1,000 metres, and a height of 45 metres. But it is understood that the
engineers have finally concluded to make no use of the waters of the Chagres,
but to change their course and let them run to the ocean through the desert;
this will be left to the last. Moreover, locks will be built to control the tides.
De Lesseps, confident that the canal will be finished in 1889, says there will
be no time in the interval to construct the locks; that they can be made
later. The chief point being that shipping shall pass through the canal.

<p class="footnote">
Scattered through this third volume have been given bibliographical notices
of about twenty of the chief works consulted in its preparation. I have now
to add a few others deserving of special mention. <i>The Gospel in Central America</i>
was written by Frederick Crowe, an Englishman, and a Baptist preacher,
who resided some time in Central America in the interest of his church. The
book—a 12mo of 588 pages, published in London, 1850—contains, as its title
implies, a sketch of the country, including British Honduras, physical and
geographical, historical and political, moral and religious. The author did
his task as well as circumstances permitted, in view of the fact that at his
violent deportation much of the material he had gathered was left behind and
never recovered. At all events, it afforded much which till then was little
known of that country. The statements contained therein not original are
credited to the sources from which they were taken; for events after the
declaration of independence the author relied on the book of travels by
Robert C. Dunlop, from which I have also culled some important facts.
<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Centro-Amerika</span></i>, and <i>Nicaragua</i>, both written in German by the traveller
C. F. Reichardt, and published in Braunschweig, in 8vo form, respectively
in 1851 and 1854; the former being of 256, and the latter of 296 pages,
one and the other provided with maps. The two works contain valuable
data, entitled to credit. <i>Aus Amerika</i>, by Julius Fröbel, issued in 1855
at Leipzig, and <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geographie und Statestif von Mexico und Centralamerika</span></i>, by
J. G. Wappäus, published at Leipzig in 1863, have also afforded much
useful knowledge. In writing this chapter on interoceanic communication,
I am indebted to the <i>Cabinet Cyclopædia</i>, directed by Dionysius Lardner,
and to John Richardson's <i>Polar Regions</i>, the first-named giving in its
first three volumes all that was known to 1830-1, on the geography of the
ancients and middle ages, and on modern voyages and discoveries. The
latter narrates the voyages made to discover the north-west passage, furnishing
likewise a view of the physical geography and ethnology of the polar
regions north and south; the whole subject, though treated in a summary
way, brings it out quite comprehensively. The <i>Report on Interoceanic Canals
and Railroads</i>, between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans—an 8vo of 37 pages
with numerous maps printed in Washington, 1867—by Charles H. Davis,
superintendent of the U. S. Naval Observatory, contains all that was known
on the subject to the time of its publication. The <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>—American
edition, issued, 1875-86, at Philadelphia—has also afforded valuable
data on the voyages in the polar seas, and on explorations and surveys connected
with canal matters. None of those works, however, nor the numerous
others consulted, have furnished the required information from the beginning
of the 19th century to the present time; and those of later years do not
usually, to any extent, go back to early ones, or if they do, it is only to give
some meagre information.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
But my researches have not been confined to books. Aside from the important
facts obtained directly from the lips of intelligent natives and other
persons conversant with Central American and Panamanian affairs, I have
had before me presidential messages, reports of ministers and other officials
of the several states, U. S. govt reports, official journals, statements of explorers
and surveyors, cyclopædias, magazines, reviews, and a host of newspapers
of different countries and in various languages, among which special
credit should be given to the <i>Star and Herald</i> of Panamá for an ever well-informed
and reliable gatherer and transmitter of news to and from the countries
on both oceans over this bridge of the nations. Important data,
wheresoever found, have been brought into requisition.

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIV-48'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIV-48'>[XXXIV-48]</a></span> 'Mr. Hopkins,' says Capt Fitzroy, p. 23, 'was lately prevented by the
Indians from ascending the Chepo River toward Mandinga or San Blas Bay;
Mr Wheelwright was also stopped there in 1837; and Dr Cullen was likewise
stopped by the aborigines while endeavoring to ascend the Paya River, that
runs from near the mouths of the Atrato to the Tuyra, which falls into the
gulf of San Miguel.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
I learned in Darien that Mr Hopkins and Don Pepe Hurtado, a Granadian
engineer, made a present of a scarlet military coat to an Indian on the Chepo,
and that as soon as the Indian chief of the district learned it, he flogged the
Indian who accepted the present, and summoned his people to arms, and
Mr H. and Don Pepe had to fly for their lives. Most probably the chief
looked upon the acceptance of gaudy trappings as an acknowledgment of submission
to foreigners. I have mentioned elsewhere my having learned subsequently
that the reason of the Indians having stopped me was the fear of
small-pox being introduced amongst them rather than any dislike to foreigners.
</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIV-49'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIV-49'>[XXXIV-49]</a></span> This I attribute to the jealousy of the Spaniards, who were careful to
withhold any information that might lead the English to the discovery of an
easy communication between the two seas. Alcedo, in his <i>Diccionario Histórico
de las Indias Occidentales</i>, says that it was interdicted, <i>on pain of death,
even to propose</i> opening the navigation between the two seas. '<span lang="es" xml:lang="es">En tiempo de
Felipe II. se proyectó cortarlo, y comunicar los dos mares por medio de un
canal, y á este efecto se enviaron para reconocerlo dos Ingenieros Flamencos,
pero encontraron dificultades insuperables, y el consejo de Indias representò
los perjuicios que de ello se seguirían á la monarquia, por cuya razon mandò
aquel Monarca que nadie propusièse ó tratase de ello en adelante, <i>pena de la

</p>

<p class='footnote' id='FN_XXXIV-51'>
<span class='fnlabel'><a href='#FA_XXXIV-51'>[XXXIV-51]</a></span> 'It is ascertained,' says Captain Fitzroy, 'that there is only a trifling difference
between the levels of the ocean at this Isthmus. A rise of tide not
exceeding two feet is found on the Atlantic side, while in Panama Bay the
tide rises more than eighteen feet; the mean level of the Pacific in this particular
place being two or three feet above that of the Atlantic. It is high
water at the same hour in each ocean.'
</p>

<p class="footnote">
Colonel Lloyd says that the Pacific at high water is thirteen feet higher
than the Atlantic, while the Atlantic is highest at low water by six feet.
Baron Humboldt said, in 1809: 'The difference of level between the Caribbean
Sea and the Pacific Ocean does not, probably, exceed nine feet; and at
different hours in the day, sometimes one sea, sometimes the other, is the
more elevated.' But this difference would be no hindrance, but, on the contrary,
a most important advantage in a ship-canal, since it would create a
current from the Atlantic to the Pacific during the ebb, and one from the
Pacific to the Atlantic during the flood-tide of the Pacific, and these alternate
currents would enable each of the fleets to pass through at different
times, those bound from the Atlantic to the Pacific during the ebb-tide of the
latter, and those from the Pacific to the Atlantic during the flood-tide of the
former. This arrangement in the periods of transit would afford many advantages,
such as obviating the meeting of the vessels, and the necessity of their
passing one another, and preventing their accumulation or crowding together
in the canal, as each fleet could be carried right through in one tide, if not by
the current alone, at least with the aid of tug steamers. The alternation of
the currents would have the further beneficial effect of washing out the bed
of the canal, and keeping it free from the deposition of sand or mud, so that
dredging would never become necessary; and would also render the degree of
width necessary for the canal less; though I do not reckon this to be a point
of moment, as the wider and deeper it is cut the better, and the work once
finished will last to the end of the world, since the natural effect of the alternate
currents will be a gradual process of deepening and widening, which will
convert the canal into a strait.
